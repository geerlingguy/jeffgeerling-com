I'm not sure why I haven't seen this before, but there's apparently an [EarthCam permanently pointed at Downtown St. Louis](https://www.earthcam.com/usa/missouri/stlouis/?cam=arch_riverview) from across the river in the Malcolm W. Martin Memorial Park, and it gives a live view of the iconic St. Louis cityscape 24x7. On a nice crisp fall evening like tonight, it looks very nice:

You can watch downtown St. Louis live on the [EarthCam - St. Louis website](https://www.earthcam.com/usa/missouri/stlouis/?cam=arch_riverview).
