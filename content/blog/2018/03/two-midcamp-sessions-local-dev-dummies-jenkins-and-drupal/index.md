MidCamp 2018 wrapped up with a bang today, as there was another year full of great training, sessions, and my favorite aspect, the 'hallway track' (where you go around and network between and during some sessions with tons of excellent Drupalists from the Midwest and around the country).

This year, I presented two sessions; one a co-presentation with Chris Urban titled [Local Dev Environments for Dummies](https://www.midcamp.org/topic/local-dev-environments-dummies), the other a solo presentation titled [Jenkins or: How I learned to stop worrying and love automation](https://www.midcamp.org/topic/jenkins-or-how-i-learned-stop-worrying-and-love-automation).

Embedded below are the video recordings of the sessions (recorded as always by the excellent Kevin Thull of Blue Drop Shop!):

Both presentations went well, and I'm glad to be able to share things I've learned with the wider Drupal community through events like MidCamp—and later this year, I'm fortunate enough to be presenting [a lab alongside Matt Grasmick on Composer](https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/how-build-drupal-site-composer-and-keep-all-your-hair)!
