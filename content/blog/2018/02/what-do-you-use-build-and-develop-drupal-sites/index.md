> **tl;dr**: Go complete the [Drupal Local Development Survey](http://bit.ly/drupal-dev-survey-2018), and we'll present the results (among other things) at MidCamp in a couple weeks!

Local development for Drupal is a subject I've invested a lot of time into. At the start of my Drupal journey, I used to use MAMP, then MAMP Pro, then a native *AMP installation. Then when I learned about Vagrant I started building Vagrant-based environments with shell scripts. Then I learned Ansible and started using Vagrant and Ansible. And then I learned Docker and used Ansible, Docker, and sometimes Vagrant!

Everyone's journey is different—but one thing most of us can agree on is: _it ain't easy finding a way to run Drupal on your local workstation if you've never done it before_.

Should you use MAMP/WAMP/XAMPP? Should you use Acquia Dev Desktop? Should you use Docker or Vagrant and build your own environment? Should you use a packaged solution like Drupal VM or Lando? And then how will you manage your codebase? How will you build a theme?

A lot of these questions haven't been adequately covered for beginners in a while, and that's why [Chris Urban](https://www.drupal.org/u/urbanlegend) and I will be presenting [Local Dev Environments for Dummies](https://www.midcamp.org/2018/topic-proposal/local-dev-environments-dummies) at MidCamp in Chicago. The session will be recorded, so even if you can't make this awesome Drupal event, you'll be able to see our answers to these questions later!

To help us fine-tune the session, we're asking anyone who's ever done Drupal development before to fill out the **[Drupal Local Development Survey](http://bit.ly/drupal-dev-survey-2018)**, and help us discover local development trends in the Drupal community!

Also, in preparation for the session, I've been compiling all the local [Drupal Development Environment Tools](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11LWo_ks9TUoZIYJW0voXwogawohqAbOFv_dcBlAVs2E/) I know if into the linked Google spreadsheet. Please take a look, comment on anything that looks like it needs updating, and let me know if I'm missing anything there!

If you're coming to MidCamp, I'll see you there! If not, check online after MidCamp for a recording of the session!
