The [St. Louis Drupal Users Group](https://www.drupalstl.org) has hosted a Drupal Camp in the 'Gateway to the West' for four years (since 2014), but this year, the organizers have decided to take a year off, for various reasons. Our camp has grown a little every year, and last year we even increased the scope and usefulness of the camp even more by adding a well-attended training day—but life and work have taken precedence this year, and nobody is able to take on the role of 'chief organizer'.

All is not lost, however! There are other great camps around the Midwest, and this year we're directing everyone to our northern neighbors, in Iowa: [DrupalCorn Camp](http://2018.drupalcorn.org) is going to be held in Des Moines, Iowa, from September 27-30, 2018!

We'll still be hosting our [monthly Drupal meetups](https://www.meetup.com/drupalstl/) throughout the year (we've had an ongoing monthly meetup in the St. Louis area for more than 10 years now!), and you can follow along with the St. Louis Drupal community (and find out about next year's Camp!) via our many [social media channels](https://www.drupalstl.org/#connect).
