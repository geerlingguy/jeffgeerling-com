This is one of those weekends where it's hard to put down my camera—there are so many beautiful trees in the neighborhood, and today's probably the last great day for leaves on the trees, as we're having 40+ mph wind gusts all day, knocking off all the weaker leaves!

I posted a set of more [fall pictures from around my neighborhood on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/albums/72157674991095668).

Interestingly, an Apple tree we planted earlier this year decided it was time to start flowering... in the fall? Ah well. Hopefully I'll get some apples in a year or two!
