I'm excited to announce I'll be presenting the session [Make your Ansible Playbooks Flexible, Maintainable, and Stable](https://agenda.fest.ansible.com/SessionDetail.aspx?id=482018) at [AnsibleFest Austin](https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest) in the first week of October.

I've spent a lot of time building, maintaining, and in a few cases, completely restructuring Ansible playbooks over the past five years. I hope to distill a lot of the lessons I've learned into this presentation, and I hope anyone else who is as passionate about infrastructure automation as I am can get a lot out of it.

As usual, I'll post slides—and hopefully video as well—from the presentation after it's over. Hope to see you in Austin!
