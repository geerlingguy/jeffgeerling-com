[<strong>Update</strong>: The Walmart should open on September 23. Here are <a href="/blog/2015/shrewsbury-mo-walmart-opens">more recent pictures from the development</a>.]

In October, I gave an <a href="/blog/2014/kenrick-plaza-walmart-redevelopment">October 2014 update Walmart redevelopment at Kenrick Plaza in Shrewsbury, MO</a>. Since it's been about six months, I figured I'd post another little update here, along with some pictures I took of the land, which now has the main Walmart structure in place, and is finally taking shape!

<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./1-kenrick-plaza-entrance.jpg" alt="Kenrick Plaza - New Entrance sign" width="500" height="375" class="blog-image" >}}</p>

View of the half-finished entrance, turning right from Watson Rd. (westbound). So far it's hard to see how pedestrian access will be routed, and where bus stops will be located (especially with the temporary access road in place), but the new sign is a bit larger than the old sign, and so far just has 'First Bank' listed.

<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./2-kenrick-plaza-old-cinema-area.jpg" alt="Kenrick Plaza - Old Kenrick Cinema area" width="500" height="375" class="blog-image" >}}</p>

A view of the old Kenrick 8 Cinema parking lot/building area. It's just a staging area for extra building materials right now, and construction vehicles frequently cross over the small driveway from the main entrance to the First Bank to get some materials and bring them to the Walmart construction area.

<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./3-kenrick-plaza-wal-mart-front.jpg" alt="Kenrick Plaza - New Walmart Front and Parking area" width="500" height="375" class="blog-image" >}}</p>

A view of the front of the new Walmart. So far it's mostly cinder block, with a few openings where the main entrance and fire escapes will be, but there are a couple small brick facades that have already been installed. Looks pretty generic so far.

I didn't get a shot of the roof, but over the past week, installers have placed dozens of large white domes all over the place, presumably the skylights used in Walmart's energy-saving <a href="http://news.walmart.com/news-archive/2005/01/07/some-facts-about-wal-marts-energy-conservation-measures">daylighting system</a>.

<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./4-kenrick-plaza-lower-powerhouse-gym.jpg" alt="Kenrick Plaza - Lower Kenrick - Powerhouse Gym" width="500" height="375" class="blog-image" >}}</p>

A view of the 'Lower Kenrick' development which has not been touched as part of the Kenrick Plaza redevelopment. You can see the long-term anchor (and one of the only tenants), Powerhouse Gym, in the middle of the frame. The parking lot, facade, landscaping, sidewalks, and pretty much every other aspect of Lower Kenrick is in a sad state of disrepair. Hearkens back to how the rest of Kenrick Plaza looked in the past. I guess you could find some low-rent retail space if you want!

<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./5-kenrick-plaza-back-of-walmart.jpg" alt="Kenrick Plaza - Back of Walmart from Trianon Pkwy" width="500" height="375" class="blog-image" >}}</p>

The back of the new Walmart building, as viewed from Trianon. It looks pretty ugly... but to be fair, the old building was just as ugly! You can only dress up the back of a development so much, especially when there are permanent guy wires in the way too.
