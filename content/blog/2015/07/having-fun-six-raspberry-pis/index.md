<blockquote>
Over the course of this year, I've acquired six Raspberry Pi model 2 B computers, and configured them in a cluster (or 'bramble') so I can use them to test different infrastructure configurations, mostly for running Drupal 8. All the Ansible playbooks and instructions for building the cluster are available on the GitHub project page for the <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-dramble">Raspberry Pi Dramble</a>. [...]

The video demonstrates Ansible's simple and powerful model of SSH-based infrastructure management <em>visually</em>. It's been a lot of fun building the Dramble and hacking both the hardware and the software to make this presentation possible!
