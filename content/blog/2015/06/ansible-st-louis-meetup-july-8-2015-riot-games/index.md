Ansible is coming to St. Louis—the hometown of Midwestern Mac, LLC, which runs Server Check.in!

The first-ever Ansible meetup in St. Louis, MO will be held at Riot Games' offices in downtown Clayton (yes, <em>that</em> Riot—the company that makes <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/">League of Legends</a>!).

Server Check.in is sponsoring refreshments for the night, and if you're interested in coming, it starts at about 7:00 p.m. There will be Ansible T-shirts and swag, and Jeff Geerling (author of <a href="https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops">Ansible for DevOps</a> and owner of Midwestern Mac, LLC) will give a crash course in Ansible and kick off discussion on how to get started with Ansible.

See more details on the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ansible-St-Louis/">Ansible St. Louis Meetup</a> page.
