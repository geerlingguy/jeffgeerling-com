I'll be speaking at <a href="https://2015.drupalstl.org/">DrupalCamp St. Louis 2015</a> at SLU LAW this weekend. My session, <a href="https://2015.drupalstl.org/conference/sessions/high-performance-drupal">High Performance Drupal</a>, will cover many quick performance wins for Drupal sites, and will fix an example site that simulates many performance problems seen on real-world Drupal sites.

Sorry it's been so long since posting here—I'm still working on my book, I've read through about 5 other books, and as always, I'm tinkering with a bunch of Raspberry Pis!
