The organizers of <a href="https://2015.drupalstl.org/">DrupalCamp St. Louis 2015</a> are excited to announce that the schedule is set for DrupalCamp STL.15; we will have sessions from a variety of presenters on a variety of topics—for both beginners and seasoned veterans alike!

Some of the great sessions lined up include a session on Git basics, the status of Migrate in Drupal 8, content strategy, securing Drupal, improving performance, improving search, Twig, and more! To kick it off, we'll have an awesome keynote from Alina Mackenzie (alimac) about getting involved in the Drupal Community.
