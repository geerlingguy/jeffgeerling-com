At long last, I found the date that the Shrewsbury, MO Walmart at Kenrick Plaza opens: September 23, 2015. I know a lot of people have asked me about this over the past year, as this blog, for some reason or another, is pretty much the <a href="/blog/2015/kenrick-plaza-walmart">only source of information about this Walmart</a> on the Internet!

Here are a couple pictures from last week:

<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./walmart-empty-lot-resized.jpg" alt="Walmart Shrewsbury MO Kenrick Plaza - empty parking lot" width="500" height="287" class="blog-image" >}}</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">This is the front of the completed Walmart building, with a completely empty parking lot. I'm guessing this will be a rare sight, judging by every other Walmart I've seen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./walmart-other-property-resized.jpg" alt="Kenrick Plaza outlot behind First Bank" width="501" height="309" class="blog-image" >}}</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">New outlot that's just west of the First Bank building. I don't know if there are any tenants signed up for the spaces in this building yet, but it's coming up quickly, since the major construction work on the new Walmart is pretty much complete.</p>
