Besides self-managed IP addresses, the most requested feature for <a href="https://hostedapachesolr.com/">Hosted Apache Solr</a> has been built-in support for file attachment indexing. Up until now, the only way you could add data from PDFs, JPGs, and other files attached to your Drupal nodes has been installing Apache Tika on your own webserver.

Today, we're happy to announce that support for attachment indexing has been added to all subscriptions on Hosted Apache Solr! You can find instructions for configuring your Drupal site to index attachments on the support page, <a href="https://hostedapachesolr.com/support/tika-attachments">Using Tika and the Attachments module to index PDFs, DOC files, etc.</a>.

If you have any trouble with attachment indexing, please <a href="https://hostedapachesolr.com/support">contact support</a>, as we may need to make an adjustment to older search cores to take advantage of this new feature!
