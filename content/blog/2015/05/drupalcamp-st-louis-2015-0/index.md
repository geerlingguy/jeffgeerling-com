<a href="https://2015.drupalstl.org/">DrupalCamp STL.15</a> (June 20-21, in St. Louis, MO) will be the first DrupalCamp in St. Louis with a day dedicated to sprints to help the Drupal community. We're expecting a great turnout, and there are already a number of <a href="https://2015.drupalstl.org/conference/program/sessions">proposed sessions</a> (many of which will be selected and announced on June 5!), and it's not yet too late to <a href="https://2015.drupalstl.org/propose-session">propose a session</a> of your own!

This year's <a href="https://2015.drupalstl.org/conference/news/keynote-alina-mackenzie-alimac">keynote</a>, by Alina Mackenzie, will focus on the Drupal Community—what it is, why it rocks, and how you can get involved in the community. After the keynote, some great sessions, a tasty lunch, <a href="https://2015.drupalstl.org/happy-hour">happy hour</a>, and a good night's rest, we'll spend <a href="https://2015.drupalstl.org/sprints">sprint day</a> (Sunday June 21) making Drupal better, and maybe even pushing Drupal 8 a little closer to an 8.0.0 rc1 release!

Registration is now open, so go <a href="https://2015.drupalstl.org/conference">reserve your spot at DrupalCamp St. Louis 2015</a>; I'll see you there, hopefully at one of the sessions I proposed, either on <a href="https://2015.drupalstl.org/conference/sessions/high-performance-drupal">High Performance Drupal</a>, or <a href="https://2015.drupalstl.org/conference/sessions/local-drupal-development-and-drupal-vm">Local Development Environments and Drupal VM</a>!
