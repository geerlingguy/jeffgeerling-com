After almost two years of writing, editing, and rewriting my book, I've finally completed the first edition of <a href="http://www.ansiblefordevops.com/">Ansible for DevOps</a>, and it's available for sale on Amazon, LeanPub, and iTunes!

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ansiblefordevops.com/">{{< figure src="./ansible-for-devops-cover_0.jpg" alt="Ansible for DevOps cover - book on Ansible by Jeff Geerling" width="301" height="391" class="blog-image" >}}</a></p>

The book is 400 pages long, just shy of 80,000 words, and was a huge effort. It's such a relief to finally have it 'out the door', though publishing-as-I-write has been a great experience. Pre-first-edition, I've already sold over 2,200 copies of Ansible for DevOps on LeanPub!

Here are a few blog posts from Server Check.in where I describe more of the publication process:

</ul>

If you've ever thought about writing your own book and self-publishing, give LeanPub a try! It's the best publishing platform for most types of books nowadays. Even if you want to go a <em>more</em> traditional route, you can self-pub with other services like CreateSpace or Lulu!
