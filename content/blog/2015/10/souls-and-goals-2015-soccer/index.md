The 'Souls and Goals' soccer match is now in its third year! The Kenrick-Glennon Seminary Lions will battle against the Clergy and Company team (comprised of a bunch of priests and a few friends, like me!).

The game will be held at <strong>St. Dominic High School</strong> on <strong>Thursday, November 5</strong>, with a kickoff at <strong>7 p.m</strong>. The game is free to anyone, and concessions will be available. More info is available on the <a href="http://www.soulsandgoals.org/">Souls and Goals</a> website (with a fresh new design for 2015).

I'll be playing in goal again this year (as part of the 'and Company' on the Clergy side), wearing my Vatican-yellow jersey! The Seminarians won the past two Cups—we'll see if we can pull off a victory this year!
