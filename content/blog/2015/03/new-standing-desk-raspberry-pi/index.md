I feel like I've been neglecting this blog for too long—the main reason is probably that most of my writing energy is still being diverted into finishing <a href="http://ansiblefordevops.com/">Ansible for DevOps</a> (I'm in the home stretch!).

Some updates, during the interim:

<ul>
<li>I just finished putting together a new standing desk (<a href="https://twitter.com/geerlingguy/status/575145349125275649">picture here</a>)—the <a href="http://www.thehumansolution.com/uplift-900-electric-sit-stand-desk-base-black.html">Uplift 900</a> desk frame along with the solid top from my existing desk (reclaimed from an office building that was sold recently). The desk is awesome, and much more stable/ergonomic than my old <a href="/articles/miscellaneous/2014/build-cubicle-standing-desk">podium-on-a-desk</a> setup (which served me well for a couple years)!</li>
<li>Besides writing the book, I've been tinkering with a new 6-node Raspberry Pi 2 cluster, christened the <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-dramble">Raspberry Pi Dramble</a> (a 'bramble' cluster of Pis running Drupal). Lots of fun to be had, and I've also been doing a lot of tinkering with Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, and circuits wired up on breadboards and soldered on perfboards (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-dramble/wiki/RGB-LEDs-controlled-via-GPIO">RGB LED control</a>).</li>
<li>I'll be in Chicago for <a href="http://2015.midcamp.org/">MidCamp</a> next weekend, presenting <a href="http://2015.midcamp.org/session-proposal/ansible-drupal-fortuitous-devops-match">Ansible + Drupal: A fortuitous DevOps match</a>, and I hope to present on Ansible and Drupal again at this year's <a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/deploying-drupal-8-bare-metal-ansible-live">DrupalCon LA</a> in May!</li>
</ul>

Sooner or later I'll get back to a somewhat regular posting schedule on Life is a Prayer—and I'll also be slowly re-consolidating other sites into one (as I've done <a href="/blog/2013/advent-simplify">in the past</a>). Until next time!
