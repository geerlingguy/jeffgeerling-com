I recently wrote a post detailing how to set up Drupal 8 on a Raspberry Pi using the Drupal Pi project (the same setup which is currently powering www.pidramble.com!) on the Acquia Developer Center blog: [Drupal and the Raspberry Pi](https://dev.acquia.com/blog/drupal-8/drupal-and-the-raspberry-pi/06/11/2015/8116).

Hopefully people will find more and more useful ways to use Drupal 8 on the Raspberry Pi for automation, for interactivity, and most of all for fun and experimentation!
