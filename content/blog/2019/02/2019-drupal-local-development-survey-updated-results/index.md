> **Update**: The results are available for viewing in our presentation slides: [download the 2019 Drupal Local Development presentation (PDF)](./DrupalCon_Seattle_Local_Dev_Survey-Slides.pdf). There is also a [video of the survey results presentation from DrupalCon Seattle](https://events.drupal.org/seattle2019/sessions/what-should-i-use-2019-developer-tool-survey-results).

It's that time of year again! Leading up to DrupalCon Seattle, Chris Urban and I are working on a presentation on Local Development environments for Drupal, and we have just opened up the [2019 Drupal Local Development Survey](http://bit.ly/drupal-dev-survey-2019).

<em>Local development environment usage results from 2018's survey.</em>
</p>

If you do any Drupal development work, no matter how much or how little, we would love to hear from you. This survey is not attached to any Drupal organization, it is simply a community survey to help highlight some of the most widely-used tools that Drupalists use for their projects.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/drupal-dev-survey-2019">Take the 2019 Drupal Local Development Survey</a></strong></p>

Chris and I will present the results of the survey at our DrupalCon Seattle session [What Should I Use? 2019 Developer Tool Survey Results](https://events.drupal.org/seattle2019/sessions/what-should-i-use-2019-developer-tool-survey-results).

We will also be comparing this year's results to those from last year—see our presentation from MidCamp 2018, [Local Dev Environments for Dummies](https://www.midcamp.org/2018/topic-proposal/local-dev-environments-dummies).
