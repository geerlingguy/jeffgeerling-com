Last year, at AnsibleFest Austin 2018, I presented _Make your Ansible playbooks flexible, maintainable, and scalable_. All the sessions at AnsibleFest were recorded, and I thought I'd be doubly safe since I presented my session on _both_ days of AnsibleFest! Alas, due to some technical glitch, all the session recordings were lost, and so the only recordings available online today are those which were re-recorded by presenters.

As life happened... re-recording the session was put on the back burner. And after many months, I started to forget the structure of the presentation (I haven't given it since AnsibleFest), so I figured I might never get around to re-recording it at home.

Luckily, though, when I was running through Final Cut Pro to archive the previous years' completed projects, I found a _practice_ recording of the session from the week before AnsibleFest. It was thankfully pretty good, and only needed a few slight edits:

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNDL13MJG6Y" frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

It doesn't capture the feeling of the room as well as a live recording, but hopefully it conveys more helpful information than the slides alone (which [I posted last year](//www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/ansiblefest-2018-wrap-slides-my-presentation-and-notes)).

[AnsibleFest Atlanta](https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest) is fast approaching, and I'd love to see you there! I'll be presenting **There's a role for that! How to evaluate community roles for your playbooks**, and maybe I'll even get some time to finish pushing out the first part of [Ansible for Kubernetes](https://www.ansibleforkubernetes.com) by then!
