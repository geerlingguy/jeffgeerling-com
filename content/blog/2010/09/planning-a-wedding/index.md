<p><a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/photos/2010/2002">{{< figure src="./Altar Crucifix.jpg" alt="Crucifix - Kenrick-Glennon Seminary" class="blog-image" >}}</a>...is involved, to say the least.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just a few days until the &#39;big&#39; day, when Natalie and I will become &#39;Mr. and Mrs. Geerling,&#39; and I&#39;m excited! It&#39;s been a thrilling year, and though things can be stressful (for both parties) at times, it&#39;s all worth it. I will get to share my entire life with one of God&#39;s most beautiful daughters, and someday (God-willing), pass it on to my beautiful children! It will be a life full of hard work, personal sacrifice, and devoted prayer.</p>
<p>As I am approaching the Wedding Liturgy, I am seeing more and more the connection between the Eucharist and the Sacrament of Marriage&mdash;most especially the sacrificial and life-giving love that Jesus has exemplified on the crucifix, and the sacrificial and life-giving love that I will soon get to share with my wife!</p>
<p>This is why Catholics exalt the Crucifix so highly, and why it often disgusts me (and others) to see a &#39;resurrexifix*&#39; at a Catholic Church; Jesus chose to die on a crucifix, to be killed in the public eye in one of the most humiliating ways, in order to take away our sin, if we let him. We don&#39;t focus on his death because we are morbid. We focus on his death because his dying act was to save our lives.</p>
<p>When I have a stressful moment, or am feeling pressure at work or home, how will I respond? Will I accept this burden with love and devotion, or will I complain? This is something that I can practice right now, and all the days of my life. I invite you to do the same.</p>
<p>I made mention of the <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/catholic-car-wash/episode/ccw-episode-1-introduction-an">importance of a crucifix</a> in my first episode of Catholic Car Wash - check it out!</p>
<p><span style="color:#a9a9a9;">*A &#39;<a href="http://www.brf.org.uk/photos/across/resurrection2.JPG">resurrexifix</a>&#39; is a cross upon which a resurrected Jesus is located... not quite a crucifix, if you ask me...</span></p>
