<p>After having seen <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrys/2329243533/">DrupliBacon</a> and <a href="http://buytaert.net/happy-fifth-birthday-drupal">DrupliCake</a> (there are other great adaptations of the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/9068">Druplicon</a> as well!), I decided I wanted to get some creative juices flowing this weekend. I present, DrupliGolf!</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./drupligolf-06-final.jpg" alt="DrupliGolf - Druplicon on a Golf Ball" >}}</p>
<p>Drupligolf is the result of a round of golf, an addiction to Drupal, and a love for the best OSS mascot in existence. (The latter reason will definitely strike a chord with anybody who&#39;s shared a drink with the Druplicon in #drupal... and actually drank).</p>

<h3>How I made the DrupliGolf Ball</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1 - Cut out face using blue painter&#39;s tape (ultra-thin variety) with razor blade.</strong></p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./drupligolf-02-tape-cut.jpg" alt="DrupliGolf - Cut Face" >}}<br />
(Measure twice... cut twice? First one was a bit small).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - Finish applying the tape-based face.</strong></p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./drupligolf-03-tapeface.jpg" alt="DrupliGolf Ball - Face Masked!" >}}<br />
(He looks so happy!).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - Paint over everything with Sharpie Paint Pen (the lighter blue variety).</strong></p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./drupligolf-05-facemask.jpg" alt="DrupliGolf Ball - Face Masked, Painted" >}}<br />
(Looks like he&#39;s on the tanning bed... bleeding blue blood).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 - Peel the paint away, enjoy your DrupliGolf ball!</strong></p>
<p>I hope I&#39;ll have more time to take pictures of the DrupliGolf ball under better lighting conditions and with my D90 (I was using my iPhone 4 to grab some quick stills on my kitchen table here...), and to enjoy a swing or two on the golf course, to see if this little guy can compete with my current favorite ball, the Callaway HX!</p>
