<p><strong>More info and recommendations: <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/articles/photography/iphone-4-ipad-external-mic-audio-input">iPhone/iPad external microphones</a></strong></p>
<p>Though my years as an audio recording engineer (I&#39;ve worked with CBS and some local audio production groups&mdash;I even helped record an <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playListId=199861842">amateur rock album</a>), I have used a wide variety of audio recording devices&mdash;8-tracks, professional reel-to-reel machines, cassette recorders, miniDisc recorders, even many current cream-of-the-crop digital audio recorders (like the Zoom H2, Zoom H4, and Marantz PMD-660 etc.).</p>
<p>Almost all of these recorders have one thing in common: <strong>they are inconvenient to have to lug around</strong>.</p>
<p>I have been experimenting with my iPhones (3G, 3Gs, and now the iPhone 4) over the years to see if I can finally find a great recording solution that will allow me to replace any need for a dedicated digital audio recorder. I think the time has finally come.</p>

<p>A few configurations I have used include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recording with the iPhone&#39;s built-in microphone</strong><br />
Example: <a href="http://www.lolsaints.com/saints/2009/superman-wuz-sold-out">Here&#39;s a podcast episode for LOLSaints.com</a> that I recorded this way. It sounds good enough for many situations, especially in quieter environments.</li>
<li><strong>Recording with a lavaliere microphone adapted through a KVConnection cable</strong><br />
Example: <a href="./iphone-external-lav.m4a">Here&#39;s a 180 KB MP4 audio file recorded in Voice Memos</a>. Works great for on-the-go interviews, but there&#39;s no analog level control pre-iPhone.</li>
<li><span style="color:#b22222;"><strong>Recording with a Shure FP12 headphone amplifier + dynamic mic</strong></span> (<em>see picture above</em>)<br />
Example: <a href="./iPhone-4-Test-Recording-with-Shure-FP12.aif">Download a 10 MB 44.1 kHz AIF file recorded in FiRe</a>. Using the FP12 allows me to not only monitor the mic signal in real time (the iPhone&#39;s circuitry introduces about a 1/10 second delay), but also allows me to control mic levels with analog precision.</li>
</ul>
<p>With apps like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/fire-field-recorder/id309378684?mt=8">FiRe</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iprorecorder-premier-voice/id293842039?mt=8">iProRecorder</a> in the App Store (I have and use both), there is no longer any reason to avoid moving my entire audio recording workflow over to my iPhone&mdash;it&#39;s always on my person, and instead of lugging around another device, I can simply carry a mic and adapter... or use the FP12 for more professional/bold sound.</p>
<p><strong>FiRe</strong> allows for input passthrough (so you can monitor what you&#39;re recording if you have a cable that splits out the mic and headphone jack, like <a href="http://www.kvconnection.com/product-p/km-iphone-2trs-a22.htm">this one from KVConnection.com</a>). It also allows for input gain adjustment&mdash;although it&#39;s better to control the gain before it gets into the iPhone/iPod, as the hardware on the device seems to have some sort of automatic limiting based on the level coming into the iPhone/iPod.</p>
<p>With most audio recording apps on the iPhone, getting the recorded files off the iPhone/iPod and into other software is easy&mdash;you can upload via FTP, email files, or browse the iPhone/iPod via your WiFi network.</p>
<h3>Level Control and Monitoring with Shure FP12</h3>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/radijoe">@radijoe</a>, I found a great portable headphone amp which plays double-duty as a mic preamp and inline analog level control in the Shure FP12. It is powered by a single 9V battery, and includes a belt clip for easy portability.</p>
<p>Here are pictures of the front/top and back/bottom of the FP12:</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./shure-fp12-top-front.jpg" alt="Shure FP12 - Top with headphone outputs, level control" class="blog-image" >}}&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;{{< figure src="./shure-fp12-bottom-back.jpg" alt="Shure FP12 - Bottom with XLR and TRS mic inputs" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
<p>As you can see, you can plug in either an XLR or TRS microphone or line-level input (there&#39;s a little mic/line input selector switch on the side of the FP12). The, on the other side, there are both 1/8&quot; and 1/4&quot; TRS connections for headphones or line-level outputs, along with a Hi-Z/Lo-Z (impedance selector) switch and an analog level control.</p>
<p>I can plug a dynamic XLR mic like the SM58 straight into the iPhone using <a href="http://www.kvconnection.com/product-p/km-iphone-micx.htm">this KVConnection.com cable</a> (<a href="http://www.kvconnection.com/product-p/km-iphone-xtrs.htm">or this one, with headphone jack</a>, or an <a href="http://vericordertechnology.mybigcommerce.com/products/XLR-Adapter-Cable.html">attenuated XLR adapter from VeriCorder</a>), but using the headphone amp allows me to do so much more.</p>
<p>This little box, either standalone, or clipped on a belt, gives me the ability to take almost any sound input and convert it into a very usable signal level for the iPhone, using a KVconnection TRRS adapter with built-in line-level attenuation. Plus, I can use the other headphone jack to plug in monitoring headphones with no delay, so I can hear exactly what&#39;s going into the iPhone.</p>
<h4>Alternatives to the Shure FP12</h4>
<p>Since the FP12 is (a) no longer being manufactured, and (b) relatively difficult to find (I got mine for a lucky $40 grab on eBay), you might look into finding a different headphone amp or powered input level adjustment device. Here are a few I can recommend (although without any guarantees as to quality):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.raysamuelsaudio.com/products/tomahawk">Emmeline &#39;Tomahawk&#39; headphone amp</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZMYRJS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmjjg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000ZMYRJS">Vox amPlug AC30 Headphone Amp</a>{{< figure src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mmjjg-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000ZMYRJS" alt="" width="1" height="1" >}}</li>

</ul>
<h3>Stereo Recording</h3>
<p>One limitation with using the iPhone&#39;s headset jack is that you can only use one channel for recording&mdash;for most of my purposes, this is fine. However, many times I would like to have a stereo recorder; either to grab a stereo sound image of a choir singing, or to record the stereo output from the radio, my computer, etc.</p>
<p>This limitation should be able to be overcome by using the iPhone/iPod Touch&#39;s Dock connector, which has pins for stereo line-level input. I&#39;m going to be experimenting with a couple solutions to see if I can get a relatively inexpensive connection wired up through the dock connector. (And I&#39;ll update this page with more info as I test different solutions).</p>
<p>Solutions I might try over the next few weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.chargeconverter.com/shop/connector.htm?connadpt.htm">Using a custom-made dock connector with a line input</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bluemic.com/mikey/new/">Using a Blue mikey for stereo environmental recording</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.alesis.com/protrack">Using an Alesis ProTrack for recording with an iPod Touch</a> (might not work with iPhone :()</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have any other ideas or tests I should perform? Leave a comment!</p>
