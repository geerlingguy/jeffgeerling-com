Over on Lifeisaprayer.com, I posted a detailed tutorial/guide on [how to replace the hard drive inside a 24" Intel iMac](http://www.jeffgeerling.com/computing/2010/intel-imac-teardown-and-hard-d) with an aluminum enclosure (the process is similar on other aluminum iMacs). It's a rather intricate process, so in addition to a few illustrations, I posted a video of the process on YouTube (it's embedded over on Lifeisaprayer.com as well!).
