Over in the [Articles](/articles) section, I posted a detailed tutorial/guide on how to [replace the hard drive inside a 24" Intel iMac](/computing/2010/intel-imac-teardown-and-hard-d) with an aluminum enclosure (the process is similar on other aluminum iMacs). It's a rather intricate process, so in addition to a few illustrations, I posted a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfQx-kpbL7o) of the process on YouTube (it's embedded in the article as well!).

Have fun repairing your iMac! (Please be sure to leave comments on the guide post, and not here).
