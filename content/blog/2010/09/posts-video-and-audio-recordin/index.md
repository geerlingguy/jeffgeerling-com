<p>If you&#39;ve glanced over on my &#39;Articles&#39; page lately, you&#39;ll no doubt notice my recent love affair (just kidding!) with the iPhone 4&#39;s audio and video recording capabilities. This blog post will offer a nice summary of all my blog posts and articles about A/V production on the iPhone (and, by extension, the new iPod Touch that was just announced today):</p>
