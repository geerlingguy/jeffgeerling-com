<p>...I&#39;ll be a married man!</p>
<p>In the next few months, my beloved fianc&eacute;e and I will be writing a few stories about our engagement and marriage preparation, as well as some of the awesome highlights of our preparation for our actual wedding and reception.</p>
<p>We might have a &#39;special section&#39; on this site for marriage-related topics (<a href="/tags/marriage">you can already read through some marriage-related posts here</a>), or we might set up shop on a different site... whatever the case, we would both appreciate any prayers you can spare for our marriage, and we will be sure to keep all of you in our prayers as well!</p>
