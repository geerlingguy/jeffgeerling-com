	...this is a question posed by KMOX Radio&#39;s Mark Reardon, who hosted an hour of some of the most confusing arguments for the Pope&#39;s resignation I&#39;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>
	His basic principle was this: Accepting the facts of the New York Times&#39; recent article bashing the Pope, should the Pope resign, as would any other head of an organization accused with being an accessory to a crime?</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately for Mark, most Catholics do not (and likely will not ever) accept the Times as a credible source of information when it comes to Catholic-bashing. There have been numerous posts on the problems in the NYT piece (some are linked to at the bottom of this post), but Mark would not for a moment entertain these problems, or any other arguments against the basis of his question.</p>
<p>
	Rather, he blamed a couple people for being insensitive to the victims of these crimes. Mark: nobody is arguing that the crimes should be shuffled under the rug or covered up. Rather, people are arguing that, in the specific instance of the NYT piece (and in most media reporting of the issue, by and large), there are serious flaws and inaccuracies that cause most rational people to discount the entire article!</p>
<p>
	Anyways, here&#39;s some good reading on the issue:</p>
