	The kit I&#39;ll be wearing at the Deaconate Ordination Mass this coming Saturday. Afterwards, I&#39;ll run to the back chapel, where I&#39;ll snap some shots with the D3 and a nice kit of SB-26 remote flashes!</p>

	{{< figure src="./IMG_1676.jpg" alt="Nikon D3 and D90 with 70-200mm VR and 50mm 1.4" width="500" height="375" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
<p>
	Is anyone selling a used D3 for cheap? I gotta get me one of these cameras!</p>
<p>
	Gear pictured above:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Nikon D3 (rented from LensRentals)</li>
	<li>
		Nikon 50mm f/1.4 AF (my own)</li>
	<li>
		Nikon D90 (my own)</li>
	<li>
		Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8 AF-S VR (rented from LensRentals)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	I&#39;m going to use the 70-200 on my D90, as the D90 has a smaller image crop, meaning the 200mm will be more like 300mm in practical use. The D3 + the 1.4 lens is a killer combo for in-the-dark shooting (the Cathedral is very dimly lit). I can still get 1/100 shutter speed at ISO 1600 and f/1.8!</p>
