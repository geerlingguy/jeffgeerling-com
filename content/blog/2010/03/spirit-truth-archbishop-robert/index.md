	Spirit and Truth is a community of young adults (there are many of them in the United States) focused on building life-giving relationships through study of Sacred Scripture, discussion of relevant issues, and, most centrally, through the worship of Jesus Christ in the Blessed Sacrament. You can read more about <a href="http://www.spiritandtruthstl.org/">Spirit and Truth St. Louis</a> on their website.</p>
