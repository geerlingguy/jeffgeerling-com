	I just upgraded my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTEyMjEwODQ5">Dropbox</a> account [<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">referral-free link</a>] from 2 GB to 50 GB; I started using the file synchronization service about a year ago, and since the day I started using it, it&#39;s been one of the best pieces of software and Internet services I&#39;ve ever used.</p>

	Neat little upgrade graphic!</p>
<p>
	There has been zero downtime, their software works flawlessly through proxies, through firewalls, through SOCKS5, etc. (and, of course, through an unprotected connection), and it&#39;s always as fast as my connection allows. I rarely give such a complete recommendation for a software product, but Dropbox, like TextMate and Tweetie, is an absolutely indispensable program for my needs.</p>
<p>
	I use it to sync all my personal files, some application preferences (I often <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5154698/sync-files-and-folders-outside-your-my-dropbox-folder">use symlinks in OSX</a> to get the preferences to sync properly), and even private files (to do this securely, I first create a secure disk image in OSX, then mount it, copy files to it, then unmount it. Once unmounted, it will sync the encrypted disk image over Dropbox to my other computers).</p>
<p>
	The only caveat is that synchronization works great, but not if you have the same file open on two of your computers at the same time. I currently use my Dropbox across 3 Macs and 2 PCs, and there hasn&#39;t been an outage on any of the computers.</p>
<p>
	If you&#39;d like to give me a little extra storage space (not that I need any, but y&#39;know, bigger is better), here&#39;s a referral link: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTEyMjEwODQ5">Create a Free Dropbox Account</a>.</p>
