<blockquote>
	Give me back that Filet O&#39; Fish, give me that fish!<br />
	Give me back that Filet O&#39; Fish, give me that fish!<br />
	What if it were <em>you</em> hanging up on this wall?<br />
	If it were <em>you</em> in that sandwich you wouldn&#39;t be laughing at ALLLLLL!</blockquote>
<p>Above are the lyrics for one of the most annoying... yet intriguing commercials ever! Who remembers McDonalds&#39; commercial (old big mac comm)? I sure do! Looks like they have another great and catchy tune on their hands, although this one doesn&#39;t have much in the way of logical sense to it.</p>
<p>You can download the jingle (or just listen to it) and be amazed... for hours and hours!</p>

<p>And below are the two (2009 and 2010) TV commercials run by McDonalds to promote their Filet O&#39; Fish sandwich. Who can ignore a talking fish, mounted on a wall?</p>
