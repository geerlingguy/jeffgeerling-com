	...of course, our rings won&#39;t be gold, nor will they be intertwined in some crazy manner which prevents either of us from ever putting them on. But they&#39;ll be on our fingers on October 2nd!</p>
<p>
	Please pray for me and for my fianc&eacute;e as we progress on the journey toward married life and communal love! Expect a few more posts about Marriage/Weddings, and about love in general, between now and then.</p>
