<p>After hearing about today&#39;s <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/06/02/atandt-announces-iphone-tethering-and-new-smartphone-data-plans/">AT&amp;T data plan pricing changes</a>, I had a pretty bad gut reaction. After thinking more about the new options, I don&#39;t quite not what to think...</p>
<p>The new data plans are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Data Plus</strong> - 200 MB of data for $15/month. Additional 200MB for another $15.<br />
<strong>DataPro</strong> - 2GB of data for $25/month. Additional 1 GB of data for $10.<br />
<strong>Tethering</strong> - Additional $20/month for DataPro customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I logged into the &#39;myAccount&#39; section of AT&amp;T&#39;s mobile website, and looked up my usage stats (there&#39;s a link to view past data usage stats), and they were relatively surprising:</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./iphone-data-usage-summary.png" alt="iPhone Data Plan Usage - Jeff Geerling" class="imagecache-article-image-large blog-image" >}}</p>
<p>It seems like I have never even come close to 2 GB, so I would be okay on the $25/month plan. However, to ask an additional $20/month to simply tether my iPhone to a single Mac or PC is ridiculous. I would be willing to pay $5, maybe $10 extra per month. But for now, I think I&#39;ll stick with jailbreaking my iPhone and using MyWi to share the iPhone&#39;s data plan with my Mac and iPad at the same time :)</p>
<p>Note: My fianc&eacute;e, who is a relatively light Internet user, had, on average, 110 MB/month usage. I think I might bump her down to the $15/month plan :)</p>
