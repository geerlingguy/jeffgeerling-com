<p>Today my iPad told me it was out of space. Not believing that for a second, I remembered that I had taken about 9 GB worth of RAW photos last weekend, and dumped them all on the iPad. I thought they were deleted by Aperture after I imported them, but I guess they weren&#39;t.</p>
<p>Lacking any easy way of deleting photos through Aperture&#39;s Import interface, <strike>or through Image Capture</strike>&nbsp;[Edit: Image Capture does allow &#39;select all&#39; or &#39;batch selection&#39; of photos to delete] (without having to reimport all the photos again), I found a useful shortcut to selecting tons of photos at once on the iPad for deletion.</p>

<p>Simply tap the share button to start selecting photos, then <strong>hold your finger down on a photo until it is selected (the little blue arrow shows up on the bottom right), and swipe your finger across multiple photos</strong>.</p>
<p>Nice!</p>
