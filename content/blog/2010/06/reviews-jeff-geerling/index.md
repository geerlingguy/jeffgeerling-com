<p>Introducing... <a href="/reviews">reviews by me!</a></p>
<p>For the longest time, I have wanted to share some of the research that I do to pick the best product for my needs, and some of the thoughts I have on a product days, weeks, and months into using it.</p>
<p>I am somewhat of a fanatic about purchasing once, and using an item to its fullest extent&mdash;never overbuying, but also never settling for something that works half of the time (I guess that&#39;s a big reason I&#39;m always a Mac... though I do see utility in a Windows PC or Linux workstation for some people).</p>
<p>In the <a href="/reviews">Life is a Prayer.com Reviews section</a>, I will be posting reviews of some of the products I have loved, and some that I haven&#39;t liked so much. All of the products I review are products that I have spent a lot of time researching for myself, and then using after purchase (for instance, the <a href="/review/photography/nikon-d90-slr-review">Nikon D90</a>, or the <a href="/review/photography/canon-powershot-g11-digital">Canon PowerShot G11</a>, both of which I spent many weeks researching before deciding to buy). I will not review a product that I have not owned, and I won&#39;t lie in my reviews.</p>
<p>One of the greatest helps for me in making a purchasing decision is seeing the thoughts of people who have a similar workflow and lifestyle to mine. I think that, if you are someone who likes to be efficient, orderly, and not let his tools get in the way of his work (as I am), you&#39;ll find some good material in the reviews that I&#39;ll be posting to this new section of my site.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be reviewing mostly tech gear, household items, and photography equipment... but anything&#39;s game!</p>
<p>Leave me a note here if there&#39;s anything in particular (category of product) you&#39;d like reviewed, and I&#39;ll see what I can do.</p>
