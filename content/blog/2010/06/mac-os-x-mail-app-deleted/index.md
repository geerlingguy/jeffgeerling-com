<p>Earlier today, when I was working on fixing a few little inconsistencies in my mail inboxes (I currently sync 5 different accounts (with a plethora of email addresses feeding into the various accounts)), deleted messages started showing in some of my inboxes in Mac OS X&#39;s built in Mail app. They were greyed out, but not enough so that I could easily distinguish non-deleted messages...</p>
<p>After looking around online for a while, and not finding any fixes for this problem (I get so many emails that showing deleted messages basically makes my inbox unusable), I thought to search the Mail help for an answer.</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./show-deleted-messages.png" alt="Show Deleted Messages" class="blog-image" >}}<br />
Pesky little menu options!</p>
<p>I found a little menu item labeled &quot;Show Deleted Messages&quot; (Command-L keyboard shortcut), which somehow had been selected at some point (I can&#39;t think of why I would hit command-l in Mail... but I guess I did). Unchecking that hid the messages. Problem solved!</p>
