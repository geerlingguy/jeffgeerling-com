<p>[<strong>Update</strong>: I have posted an article about <a href="/articles/computing/2011/my-computing-history-all-compu">all the computers I've owned</a>].</p>
<p>Pictured below (in the final year of its existence) is the first computer I ever called my own. Built out of scrap parts my Dad brought home from his office, I managed to build the computer as a 33 Mhz 386, with 2 MB of RAM and a 20 MB hard drive, eventually upgrading it (in stages) to a 66 Mhz 486 with 8 MB of RAM and a 512 MB hard drive!</p>

mmm... SCSI in a PC!</p>
<p>How, you may ask, could a diehard Mac/Apple fanboy start on a 386? Well, it was all about budget, you see. Free is good, especially when you&#39;re a little kid with absolutely zero dollars in the bank.</p>
<p>This computer died shortly after this photo was taken, when I was unplugging a connector from the motherboard while the computer was still powered up. Something sparked, I got the largest jolt of my life, and the computer started smoking. Oh well, such is life.</p>
<p>The one thing I really miss about those early days of computing (and using PCs in general ;-) was the physicality and brutality of computing. I would spend about 1/8 of the time using the computer with the lid off, working in the guts. I would constantly upgrade parts inside to make it a lean, mean, computing machine. Heck, I could still draw diagrams of the three different motherboards that were housed inside the case pictured above, and make an accurate diagram of all the components I had installed at one time or another, and how they were connected together.</p>
<p>With the complexity of computers these days, and the miniaturization and virtualization of everything, tinkering is much more limited. But that&#39;s just nostalgia talking&mdash;I&#39;m kind of glad I haven&#39;t shocked myself touching my iMac, iPad or iPhone yet.</p>
