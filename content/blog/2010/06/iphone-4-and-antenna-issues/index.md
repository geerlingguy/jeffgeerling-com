<p>A lot of people have been mentioning how horribly terrible the iPhone 4&#39;s 3G antenna seems to be, due to an issue that has affected somewhere around half of iPhone 4 users (according to <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/06/26/macrumors-poll-iphone-4-signal-loss-by-region/">this MacRumors poll</a>) so far.</p>
<p>Wanting to see this issue for myself, and knowing an iPhone 4 is on its way already, but will be delayed another week, I went to my local Apple Store, and tested five different iPhone 4&#39;s. All five exhibited the exact signal loss problem: If you grip the iPhone rather tightly with your wrist pressing against the lower-left corner of the iPhone, the 3G bars gradually diminish to zero, and the signal is lost.</p>
<p>However, based on further observations, I don&#39;t think this will be an issue for 99% of iPhone 4 users, ever. While I was in the store, the only time I observed this issue was when I intentionally held the iPhone in that position&mdash;during normal use, I never pressed my wrist against that area of the phone.</p>
<p>And, looking around at the 16 iPhone 4 display models, <em>none</em> the people touching them to look at various functions of the iPhone were holding them in such a way as to cause signal loss.</p>
<p>I think it&#39;s a bunch of media alarmism. I&#39;m extremely pleased with how well the iPhone 4 functions in every other regard, and I can&#39;t wait to receive mine next week!</p>
<p>The camera test shots I took were good enough that I will probably never carry my <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/review/photography/canon-powershot-g11-digital">Canon G11</a> on another trip with me, even though I love the pictures I can get with it.</p>
