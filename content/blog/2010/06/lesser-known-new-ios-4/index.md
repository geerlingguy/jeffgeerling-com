<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./iOS 4 Software Update.gif" alt="iOS 4 Software Update" width="429" height="67" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
<p>Besides a couple of the very helpful new features of <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/softwareupdate/">iOS 4</a> like folders, multiple Exchange accounts, and unified inboxes, there are a few things I&#39;ve been finding in my use of the new OS that are underrated, but very helpful improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the iPod app, you can now edit, delete, and create playlists.</li>
<li>If you plug the iPhone into a device which may cause interference, instead of giving you a vague popup asking you to put the iPhone into Airplane mode (which was almost always unnecessary), a popup simply says &quot;there might be interference with this device,&quot; with only one button to dismiss the message.</li>
<li>The Contacts app is much faster when searching an Exchange global address book. Still can&#39;t browse the global address book, though.</li>
<li>Multiple apps/switching is really quite easy, and extremely useful. On top of that, it happens transparently&mdash;you don&#39;t feel the need to do anything extra to use this feature.</li>
<li>5x Digital Zoom works great with the camera for stills, but doesn&#39;t do anything for video (not like I&#39;d want to do that anyways&mdash;it would result in pretty blurry video!</li>
<li>The Photos app has been rearranged in a very good way&mdash;now you can tab through Faces, Places, Events, etc. directly, rather than having everything in one huge album list.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few small quibbles I have so far, like Pandora&#39;s inability (so far) to run in the background&mdash;that will have to wait for an update&mdash;but on the whole, I&#39;m glad I tried out the golden master preview of iOS 4 on my iPhone 3GS.</p>
