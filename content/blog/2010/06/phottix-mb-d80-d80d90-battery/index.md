<blockquote class="tldr"><strong>tl;dr</strong>: You can (and should) pick up one of these things if you have a D90 or D80, and shoot vertically or need extra juice for the camera. The Nikon MB-D80/OEM model is a bit more solid, but you can't beat the Phottix's price!</blockquote>

<p>Take a look at what&#39;s hanging on the neck of almost any professional photojournalist, wedding photographer, or camera guy&mdash;you&#39;ll almost always see the tank-like and bulky body of a Nikon D1/2/3/X-series or Canon 1D-series SLR. The Phottix MB-D80 takes your D90 (in my case&mdash;it also works on the D80, though) and gives it three of the tank-like bodies&#39; functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>A vertical shutter release/controls: When shooting portraits, this is immensely helpful.</li>
<li>Double the battery life: You can stick an extra Nikon EN-EL3e battery in the grip (bringing your total to 2 batt&#39;s!).</li>
<li>Look like a serious photographer: &#39;Nuff said.</li>
</ol>
<p>The battery grip performs great, it can take a beating, and the shutter release and controls feel almost as good as using the controls on the camera body itself!</p>

<p>Some people (myself included) are leery of purchasing a battery grip, or anything else that&#39;s more integral to your camera&#39;s operation than a lens-cleaning wipe, that&#39;s not Nikon-branded, since the thing has the potential to fry your camera if wired improperly. But allay those fears: this grip is professional grade... and a heck of a lot more value for your money than the Nikon grip.</p>
<h3>Appearances</h3>
<p class="rtecenter"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/3474757253/" title="Self-Portrait - D90 with Phottix Battery Grip by geerlingguy, on Flickr">{{< figure src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3662/3474757253_2689712e94.jpg" alt="Self-Portrait - D90 with Phottix Battery Grip" width="396" height="500" >}}</a></p>
<p>There&#39;s nothing quite like a battery grip to make a run-of-the-mill prosumer or consumer digital SLR look like one of the &#39;big boys&#39; (Nikon D3, Canon 1D, etc.). The grip adds a bit of bulk, an optional extra battery for extended shooting, and looks to kill for.</p>
<p>This particular Phottix model looks right at home molded to the bottom of the D90, and the rubberized grip is pretty easy to hold. The buttons look a tiny bit plasticky, and you can tell up-close that the labels are a cheaply printed, but from a foot or two away, nobody will ever know the difference between this Phottix model and the Nikon-branded grip.</p>
<h3>Function</h3>
<p>The grip is perfect for allowing quick vertical snapshots, and doesn&#39;t add enough weight to make toting the D90 a chore, even with two batteries inside. It&#39;s painless to put on and take off. To put it on, you just pop off the end cap, pop off the D90&#39;s battery door (this is the hardest part, but it gets easier over time), then slide in the battery grip, tightening it with a thumb-screw that goes in the tripod socket.</p>
<p>The only functional problem I have with the grip is that the only point of physical/substantial contact it has with the camera body is the tripod screw, meaning that it has a tiny bit of give when you are holding the camera with one hand using the battery grip alone. It never feels like it&#39;s going to break or come off, but it simply doesn&#39;t feel rock solid, like a D3. You get what you pay for...</p>
<p>Finally, the MB-D80 even comes with a nice little plastic end cover for the pins that go into the camera body, so when you store the grip apart from the camera, the pins won&#39;t bend. Just make sure you don&#39;t lose the cap!</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Using the vertical battery grip, you can stick two Nikon EN-EL3e batteries at once, effectively doubling the amount of shots you can take with the D90. One weekend, I shot an Ordination Mass, some shots in a park, a reception, then a priests&#39; first Mass and reception the next day, totaling probably 1,500 shots, with nary a battery charge. Of course, I never use the built in flash, and I usually only chimp a few images here and there.</p>
<p>The grip also comes with a 6-AA battery holster, into which you can insert a bunch of AA batteries and use lieu of one or two Nikon battery packs. The AA&#39;s won&#39;t last as long (with some stock Energizers, mine lasted about 200 shots, without flash), but they sure as heck help in a tight situation (i.e. you forgot your charger on an out-of-town trip!). The holster itself isn&#39;t all that well-made (it seems like an afterthought), and mine snapped in half after the third use. I put it back together, but duct tape doesn&#39;t hold up too well in this case :-(</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>You can (and should) pick up one of these things on eBay or elsewhere for around <span itemprop="price">$80</span>. Just make sure you&#39;re buying from a reputable dealer (mine shipped from Hong Kong in about a week and a half).</p>
