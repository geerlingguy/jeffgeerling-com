<p>From Seth Godin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Factories used to be arranged in a straight line. That&#39;s because there was one steam engine, and it turned a shaft. All the machines were set up along the shaft, with a belt giving each of them power. The office needed to be right next to this building, so management could monitor what was going on.</p>
