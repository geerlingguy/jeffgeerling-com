<p>From <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/05/31/google-switches-away-from-windows-mostly-to-mac-due-to-security-concerns/">MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google is phasing out the use of Windows company-wide due to security concerns. The move comes after news in January that Google was hacked in an attack originating in China. Those attacks used a security vulnerability in Internet Explorer for Windows. News of the report comes from FT.com who cites several Google employees.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re not doing any more Windows. It is a security effort,&quot; said one Google employee.</p>
<p>The majority of those moving away from Windows PCs are moving to Mac OS according to another Google employee. New hires are given the option to run Mac OS or a Linux-based machine.</p>
<p>Google employs over 10,000 individuals worldwide.</p>
