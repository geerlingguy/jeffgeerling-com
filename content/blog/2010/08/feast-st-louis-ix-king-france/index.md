<p>The Archdiocese of St. Louis is celebrating the feast of its patron saint today, St. Louis IX. Saint Louis was a very generous man, always giving to the poor, helping charitable organizations and religious orders, and generally being the kind of king who tries to please God rather than man.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://archstl.org/archstl/post/feast-saint-louis-ix-king-france">read more about the feast of St. Louis IX</a> (and about the man himself) on the Archdiocese of St. Louis&#39; website.</p>
