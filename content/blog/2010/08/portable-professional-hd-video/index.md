<p><em>Please read this article for background/more info: <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/articles/photography/iphone-4-ipad-external-mic-audio-input">iPhone/iPad external microphones</a></em></p>
<p>I am now pretty confident in my portable video/audio recording solution using my iPhone 4. Everything I need to do on-the-spot interviews, B-roll filming, and even more advanced shooting, I can fit in my iPad&#39;s&nbsp;bag.</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./Portable Recording Studio.png" alt="Portable Recording Studio with iPhone 4" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my basic setup - everything I need (with the exception of the iPhone 4), I put together for under $100:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 4 Tripod mount + mini Targus tripod (<a href="/photography/2010/diy-10-iphone-4-3g3gs-tripod">here&#39;s how you make the iPhone tripod</a>)</li>
<li>External Lavaliere microphone + adapter for iPhone 4 (<a href="/articles/photography/iphone-4-ipad-external-mic-audio-input">here&#39;s what I&#39;m using, along with some samples, and microphone recommendations</a>)</li>
<li>An interview mic setup - so far not ideal, but getting there (<a href="/blog/2010/microphone-impedance-matching">a Shure SM58 with the iPhone 4</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup is ideal for interviews, recording video podcasts, and, with the help of another DIY project on which I&#39;m working, recording video with some interesting perspectives.</p>
