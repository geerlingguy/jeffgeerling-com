<p><a href="http://celebration.sqpn.com/">{{< figure src="./cnmc-twitter-300x300-150x150.jpg" alt="CNMC MMX - August 2010" class="blog-image" >}}</a><strong>[UPDATE</strong>: The Archdiocese of St. Louis now has an immense post with more links, pictures, quotes, etc. <a href="http://archstl.org/webdev/post/catholic-new-media-celebration-mmx">View it here</a>.<strong>]</strong></p>
<p>This year&#39;s <a href="http://celebration.sqpn.com/">CNMC MMX</a>&nbsp;(Catholic New Media Convention 2010) was bigger and better than last year&#39;s convention; the venue had excellent WiFi access, there were even more Catholic media/new media representatives, and the atmosphere was generally more lively and exciting (mostly due to the great number of amazing people).</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights from the convention, and links to more pictures and information:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bostoncatholic/collections/72157624669495372/">Photos from Boston Catholic on Flickr</a> (Very nice pictures! The photographer used an EyeFi + 3G Hotspot to continually upload photos on the go) - Also check out <a href="http://parishgeeks.com/2010/08/cnmcmmx/">Scott Maentz&#39;s&nbsp;photos</a> (he runs <a href="http://parishgeeks.com/">ParishGeeks.com</a>)</li>

<li>Also during the event, I <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2010/announcing-catholic-car-wash-a">announced</a> the new &quot;<strong><a href="/catholic-car-wash">Catholic Car Wash</a></strong>&quot; video podcast, which has already had over 400 views! I&#39;m excited about this new endeavor, and I hope to create many more episodes in the coming years.</li>
<li>Finally, in the <a href="http://celebration.sqpn.com/new-media-gallery/">New Media Gallery</a>, I presented (sadly, only for a short time) one of the features of the Archdiocese of St. Louis&#39; website, &quot;social publishing&quot; - you can <a href="http://archstl.org/webdev/imagegallery/presentation-catholic-new-media-gal">view the slides here</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, after finding that so many people have become rather enamored with <a href="http://www.lolsaints.com/">LOLSaints.com</a>, I&#39;ve decided to start working on it a bit more again. Expect many more laughs, and many more wonderful featured saints in the next months!</li>
