<p>I&#39;ll be hanging around a bunch of other Catholic techies this Saturday in Boston, MA, at the <a href="http://celebration.sqpn.com/">Catholic New Media Celebration</a>. In case you haven&#39;t heard, I just started a new podcast, <strong><a href="/catholic-car-wash">Catholic Car Wash</a></strong> (<a href="/blog/2010/announcing-catholic-car-wash-a">read more about it</a>), and I thought CNMC MMX would be a great venue for its introduction.</p>
<p>A good friend and fellow Catholic programmer/blogger, Matthew Warner, spent much of last night individually uploading tons of photos from last night&#39;s meet-and-greet. I figured I&#39;d take the opportunity to send out a &#39;miss you&#39; wish to my fianc&eacute;e, Natalie:</p>

<p>You can see all of his photos here: <a href="http://www.ncregister.com/blog/catholics-in-new-media-cnmc-kickoff">Catholics in New Media: CNMC Kickoff</a></p>
<p>I am here representing the Archdiocese of St. Louis&#39; Office of Web Development, and I&#39;m already happy to have spoken to tons of great Catholics about blogging, social media, podcasting, etc. Later this afternoon I&#39;ll be highlighting the Archdiocesan website in a short presentation, and I&#39;ll &#39;represent&#39; in a blogger&#39;s panel.</p>
