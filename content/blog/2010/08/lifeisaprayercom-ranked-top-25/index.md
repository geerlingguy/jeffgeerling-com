<p>Due almost exclusively to the <a href="/articles">Articles</a> section of this website, it seems that Lifeisaprayer.com (this website) <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/jeffgeerling.com">ranks at number 422,290</a> of approximately 180,000,000 websites on the Internet (according to Alexa).</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./lifeisaprayer-rank-alexa.png" alt="Alexa Internet Traffic Ranking for Lifeisaprayer.com" width="408" height="57" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
<p>The most popular content on the site, by a very large margin, are the following articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/articles/computing/mac-running-slow">My Mac is Running Really Slow - Help!</a></li>
<li><a href="/articles/photography/diy-greenscreen">DIY: Greenscreens and Backdrop or Background Stands</a></li>
<li><a href="/articles/photography/iphone-4-ipad-external-mic-audio-input">iPhone 4 (and iPad) - External Mic for Audio in Camera App (etc.)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These articles alone count for about 70% of daily traffic, almost exclusively through Google.com search results. Since migrating this website from a custom HTML website (everything was posted through Dreamweaver and Thingamablog) to Drupal, with much better theme organization, my traffic has increased about 20%.</p>
<p>This post was prompted by <a href="http://archstldev.com/story/2010/archstlorg-ranks-top">some research</a> for one of the other large websites I maintain, <a href="http://archstl.org/">archstl.org</a> - which is ranked a little over 800,000. I looked up <a href="http://nmap.org/favicon/?q=jeffgeerling.com">jeffgeerling.com on the </a><a href="http://nmap.org/favicon/?q=jeffgeerling.com">NMAP Favicon graph</a>, and found it (a tiny, but visible, icon :)</p>
