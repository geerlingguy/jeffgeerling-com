<p>This is my first blog post from the iPad. Unfortunately, the iPad doesn't work with CKEditor, which I am using on this website, so I have to use the plain text editor. Luckily, typing on the iPad isn't too much of a chore, although it is pretty easy to lose your finger positions while typing.</p>

<p>I think that's all I'll type for now, because my hands are getting tired, and it's about time to go to bed. But hopefully Ill have some more time to test out typing on the iPad tomorrow.</p>

<p>As an aside, you can't use Drupal's built-in file uploading (via FileField) with the iPad, at least not natively. I'll have to investigate this more over the next few weeks. There's got to be a way to add a picture to a blog post!</p>
