	These images speak for themselves, but I will offer a few asides to help explain why I was saddened after visiting the <a href="http://www.holynamecathedral.org/">Holy Name Cathedral</a> in Chicago a few months ago.</p>
<p class="rtecenter">
	{{< figure src="./Holy Name Cathedral - Eucharistic Tabernacle.jpg" alt="Tabernacle - Holy Name Cathedral, Chicago" class="imagecache-article-image-large blog-image" >}}<br />
	<span style="color:#696969;">What... the... I think they might reserve the Body of Christ somewhere in that mess.</span></p>
<p class="rtecenter">
	{{< figure src="./Holy Name Cathedral - Rose Stained GlassWindow.jpg" alt="Rose Window - Holy Name Cathedral, Chicago" class="imagecache-article-image-large blog-image" >}}<br />
	<span style="color:#696969;">To think that, before the fire, there was probably very beautiful, meaningful and symbolic imagery in that stained glass. Now it&#39;s an abstract, and dare I say, <em>boring</em> sight. My eyes grew tired trying to see what was up there.</span></p>

<p class="rtecenter">
	{{< figure src="./Holy Name Cathedral - Pipe Organ and Loft.jpg" alt="Pipe Organ - Holy Name Cathedral, Chicago" class="imagecache-article-image-large blog-image" >}}<br />
	<span style="color:#696969;">Amazingly, it seems the beautiful wood ceiling and majestic pipe organ were unharmed by the Cathedral&#39;s renovations. However, it seems Spider Man paid a visit to the Cathedral&#39;s narthex (the little gathering area in the back with spider webbing).</span></p>
<p class="rtecenter">
	{{< figure src="./Holy Name Cathedral - Sanctuary.jpg" alt="Sanctuary - Holy Name Cathedral, Chicago" class="imagecache-article-image-large blog-image" >}}<br />
	<span style="color:#696969;">The sanctuary, at first glance looks like it would be able to attract the eyes for a visual treat. However, upon closer inspection, the crucifix is distracting, the stained glass windows are simply a mess (there is seemingly random/patchy colors all over&mdash;not even abstract figures), and the altar and sanctuary area is almost completely unadorned.</span></p>
<p>
	The general lack of ornamentation in the Cathedral was very disheartening. And what was present was horribly out of place in such a gothic and majestic structure! Some of the best reading I&#39;ve had on the issue of modern Church renovations and architecture is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1586171534?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmjjg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1586171534">No Place for God: The Denial of Transcendence in Modern Church Architecture</a>{{< figure src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mmjjg-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1586171534" alt="" width="1" height="1" >}}, by Moyra Doorly. This Church should definitely be listed as an exemplar Church for the book!</p>
