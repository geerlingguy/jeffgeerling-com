	<strong>[UPDATE: I have posted <a href="/review-apples-ipad-32gb-tested">my rather extensive review of the iPad</a>. It will be updated frequently!]</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>[UPDATE x2: I have posted a guide to <a href="/articles/computing/tethering-your-ipad-to-your-iphone">tethering your iPad to your iPhone</a>.]</strong></p>
<p>
	I just returned from a shopping trip with stops at Best Buy, Micro Center and the Apple Store (specifically, the smaller of two Apple Stores in the St. Louis Metro Area). A tip for those looking to buy an iPad: DON&#39;T go to the Apple Store. Not only are many Apple Stores running out, but Best Buy also has a nice $30 for $25 iTunes gift card deal.</p>
<p>
	If you&#39;re going to buy at least $30 worth of apps for your iPad, the Gift Card deal is pretty good. Plus, there are no lines at Best Buy. Best Buy doesn&#39;t have any accessories, but neither does Apple right now (they&#39;re all out of stock).</p>
<p>
	More to come on the iPad... along with my first blog post from the thing :-)</p>
