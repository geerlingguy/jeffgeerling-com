<p>Below is the full-size image mockup I made for webchick to highlight the awesomeness of Drupal&#39;s (relatively) new stark theme, as seen in Drupal 7. You can download Stark for Drupal 6 as well, but it will be a nice way to quickly expose the underpinnings of Drupal&#39;s core HTML output.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be working on at least one CSS-only theme for Drupal 7 over the next couple of months, and will hopefully release it to drupal.org by summertime. The transition from 6-&gt;7 is going to be awesome for themers!</p>
