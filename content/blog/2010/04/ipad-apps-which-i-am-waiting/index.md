<p>My credit card is quite ready to dump some money on the following, when they&#39;re released:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coda for iPad: We need a good IDE for the iPad, and Coda screams iPad, already; I would be willing to heft over a pretty penny to have Coda on my iPad... even without terminal support, or the useless CSS editor.</li>
<li>Podcasting Suite: Something like GarageBand lite; just enough to record multiple tracks (maybe 2-4, with the ability to split right and left channels from a USB audio input (like the iMic) into separate tracks. Then add in a small library of music beds, stingers, etc., and I&#39;m in love.</li>
<li>Tabbed Browser ala Safari on the Mac. Even if I can only open three or four tabs, it would be so nice to leave them open for later viewing, without having to leave my current browser tab/window.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coda is the only one for which I really have a pressing need. The others can wait, but would be awesome.</p>
