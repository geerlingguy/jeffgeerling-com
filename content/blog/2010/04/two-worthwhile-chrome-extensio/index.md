<p>
	I&#39;ve been using Chrome as my primary browser for about three weeks now, and two of the most essential extensions I&#39;ve found are listed below. I&#39;m still not 100% sold on Chrome, especially because of privacy concerns (do I really want <em>all</em> of my digital life stored on Google and accessed through Google?), but it&#39;s fast, and it&#39;s almost less buggy than Safari.</p>
