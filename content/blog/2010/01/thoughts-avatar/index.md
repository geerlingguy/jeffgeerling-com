	From a friend&#39;s <a href="http://jsignal.com/b2/index.php/2010/01/16/avatar-c-s-lewis-and-a-brave-new-world">blog post on Avatar</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		People applauded at the end of the film, which I found a bit disturbing. Visually, it was awesome. But we just saw humanity slaughtered on an alien planet. We just saw the greed of humanity at its worst. We just saw a terrible spirituality exalted as ideal. And, finally, we just saw the remnant of the humans sent back &ldquo;to their dying planet,&rdquo; and we cheered.<br />
		<br />
		No wonder people feel depressed after stepping out of the theater and back into reality. We are scum. We are parasites. We deserve to die on this rotting planet for our sins against Mother Earth.<br />
		<br />
		Yet people applauded. Was it just the visuals that they were applauding? Was it the predictable love story or battle scenes? I hope so, but doubt it. Many people are not seeking the transcendent God of reality, the one whose beauty and perfection we see reflected in that awesome beauty of the real planet Earth and in the cosmos. People are not seeking the transcendent God whose truth and wisdom is reflected in our own intellect and the sciences. Instead, they are stuck with a smallness of vision and are, even if they don&rsquo;t realize it, turning to the religions of environmentalism and animism. Do not weep if a tree is felled in the forest. Yes, use the forest responsibly as a precious resource given to humanity by God. But don&rsquo;t worship it. Worship its Creator!</p>

	I felt the same way at the end of this film: are we so far removed from the truth that we can&#39;t see how truly good is humankind? We have dignity, and we are a beautiful creation. Pandora is a substitute reality for the divine reality, and a lot of people in our culture, who have rejected God completely, find solace in Pandora, or in an idea of &#39;mother nature&#39; and the interconnectedness of beings.</p>
<p>
	Little do these people know: they can experience this oneness with creation, and this ecstatic union with the divine, simply by conversion of heart and receiving Jesus Christ!</p>
