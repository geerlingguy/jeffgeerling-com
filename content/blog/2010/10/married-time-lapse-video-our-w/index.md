Below is a time-lapse video of my wedding, generously recorded/posted by my Aunt (I didn't even know she did it!). I will hopefully have some pictures to post to Facebook sooner or later, and will also be posting a few of those previously-promised posts about our wedding preparations to this site, and to [my and my wife's wedding website](http://geerlingguyandgirl.com/).

Here's the video (the techno beat adds something... I just don't know what ;-):
