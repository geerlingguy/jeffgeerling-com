<p>{{< figure src="./nick-cannon3417.jpg" alt="Nick Cannon - I'm a Daddy!" class="blog-image" >}}Now here&#39;s a music star (and TV show host) I can sympathize with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The greatest gift on earth is a child&quot; ...</p>
<p>&lt;Reporter:&gt; Would you like to a dad? &lt;Nick:&gt; &quot;I mean, yeah, <strong>that&#39;s the purpose of union and gettin&#39; married, to have a family</strong>. We&#39;d love to expand!&quot;</p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.accesshollywood.com/access-exclusive-mariah-carey-and-nick-cannon-we-are-pregnant_article_38934">Source</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nick is also known for his pro-life rap video Can I Live (definitely worth a watch, if you haven&#39;t seen it before). This guy gets it&mdash;he&#39;s a well-known rap singer, host of America&#39;s Got Talent, and is married to Mariah Carey, one of the most popular singers in the U.S. today.</p>
<p>While their marriage is assuredly not perfect (nobody&#39;s is...), they already dealt with a miscarriage, and are now expecting their first child (likely not to be their last!).</p>
<p>So... why can Hollywood stars &#39;get it&#39; with regard to marriage and family, and half or more of Catholics can&#39;t?</p>
