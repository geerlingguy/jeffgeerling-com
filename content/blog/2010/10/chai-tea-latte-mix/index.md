<p><a href="/blog/2010/chai-ed-knot-making-500-servin">A recent project on which I spent many hours</a> required the production of many gallons of Chai Tea Latt&eacute; Mix; After enjoying a few cups of this extremely tasteful drink, I thought I&#39;d post the recipe I used here, as well as a few notes for the mixing directions which will help point you in the right direction.</p>

(You probably won&#39;t need quite this quantity of ingredients. Not pictured: the dry milk powder.)</p>
<p>The key to the mix is to make it really, really smooth. After you&#39;ve finished mixing the chai in the food processor, you&#39;ll be rewarded with a very beautiful fragrance&mdash;you can almost breathe in the caffeine and sugar! One of the nicest things about homemade chai mix is that you can store it for quite some time, and it will still taste amazing.</p>

<h3>Recipe for Homemade Chai Tea Mix (makes 5 cups)</h3>
<ul>
<li>3 cups nonfat dry milk powder</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
<li>1 cup unsweetened instant tea</li>
<li>3/4 cup powdered nondairy creamer, vanilla</li>
<li>1 1/2 tsp. ground ginger</li>
<li>1 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
<li>1/2 tsp. ground cardamon</li>
<li>1/2 tsp. ground cloves</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>In a food processor, combine all dry ingredients (it&#39;s a good idea to pre-mix in a large mixing bowl with a spoon); cover and process until powdery. Store in airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to six months.</p>
<p>Serving instructions: 3 tbsp. per serving, mixed with 6 oz. (3/4 cup) of hot water. Dollop with whipped cream if desired.</p>
<p>*Note: If instant tea is course, you might want to pre-process it. Nestea doesn&#39;t seem to have this problem, but some other brands do.</p>

(The final product... you probably won&#39;t end up with quite as much. We had about 15 bowls.)</p>
