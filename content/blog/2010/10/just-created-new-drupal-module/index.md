<p>I just created my second open source software project (for Drupal), <a href="http://drupal.org/project/gallery_archive">Gallery Archive</a>. This is the first Drupal module I&#39;ve created, and I&#39;m excited to be able to dive into many more APIs I&#39;ve not yet interacted with. Drupal has been a great adventure in my life, and I&#39;m finally getting good enough with &#39;drupal-fu&#39; (like kung-fu, but in Drupal-speak) that I can come up with solutions to my own problems :)</p>
<p>The Gallery Archive module basically allows users to download an archive file containing all the images in a given photo gallery on a Drupal-based website. This is extremely useful for a few different purposes, but I&#39;ll detail my use case below:</p>
<p>For about a year now, I&#39;ve had a password-protected picture-sharing website for my family, and instead of using an online photo sharing service (which usually has limitations, sometimes costs money, and is never a surefire solution (some services just vanish overnight, and you lose your data!), I decided to create my own site.</p>
<p>So far, a few family members have created accounts to share/view/download pictures, but the biggest gotcha has been the inability to download a whole gallery (or at least many files) at once. Users had to click on an image to get to the full-size image, save that, go back, click on another image, etc... It took a long time for galleries with more than 20 pictures (pretty much all of &#39;em).</p>
<p>So, I built this module, and now people are happy :D</p>
