<p>Photo of the sky with sunlight peering through clouds, as seen in Shrewsbury, MO. This is actually almost exactly how the scene looked IRL, which is a high praise of the iPhone 4&#39;s camera and HDR abilities&mdash;it&#39;s not so pronounced as to take the natural beauty out of a photo, but enough to strengthen the contrast ratio a bit.</p>
<p>The iPhone 4 is a great <a href="/articles/photography/iphone-4-ipad-external-mic-audio-input">video camera</a>, <a href="/articles/computing/2010/iphone-ipod-digital-audio-recording-external-microphones">professional audio recorder</a>, photo camera, and mobile Internet access device. I&#39;m glad to be an owner :)</p>
