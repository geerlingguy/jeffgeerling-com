	After reading <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_wants_to_be_your_one_true_login.php#comments">this comment thread about Facebook logins</a>&nbsp;on ReadWriteWeb, I feel sad to call myself a Facebook user. The sheer number of clueless users who actually thought ReadWriteWeb was Facebook is a sad fact. The fact that they login to facebook by going to Google and typing in &quot;Facebook Login&quot; is also sad. Could they not simply type in facebook.com? I guess the idea of a URL is too outlandish for people.</p>

	What about a bookmark? My grandma, who only does a few things on the web, knows how to make a bookmark and go back to it. A lot of the Facebook users who posted comments looked quite a bit younger than my grandma, and, apparently, they cannot figure out things she could do in her sleep!</p>
<p>
	The takeaway? SEO counts. If someone types in &quot;Best Hardware Store in St. Louis,&quot; it seems likely they&#39;ll believe whatever Google gives as the first result. It&#39;s pretty easy to target these kinds of searches... and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good thing or a bad thing.</p>
