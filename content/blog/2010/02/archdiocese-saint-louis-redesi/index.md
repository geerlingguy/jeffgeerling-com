<p>
	The Archdiocese of Saint Louis today upgraded its entire website to a new design and a new platform, allowing offices and agencies to more quickly and more easily communicate with the faithful in the Archdiocese (and around the world!).</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ve been working on this project (with a lot of help from Palantir, a web development company in Chicago) and some local developers for the past year, and I am pleased with the result (I hope you are, too!). I&#39;ve written up more information about the technical aspects of the site on Open Source Catholic (read more about the <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/oscatholic/archdiocese-saint-louis-upgraded-website">Archdiocese of Saint Louis&#39; Upgraded Website</a>), and I will continue writing some posts about specific details on the Open Source Catholic website.</p>
<p>
	Some of the highlights of the redesign:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The new Archdiocesan-wide <a href="http://archstl.org/calendar">Calendar of Events</a></li>
	<li>
		The revamped <a href="http://archstl.org/prayer/request-a-prayer">Prayer Request</a> system</li>
	<li>
		The accessible and standards-compliant design (tested in all major browsers)</li>
	<li>
		A new <a href="http://archstl.org/parishes">Parish</a>, <a href="http://archstl.org/schools">School</a>, and <a href="http://archstl.org/organizations">Organization</a> directory.</li>
	<li>
		Every organization now has a more unified interface, and the adminstrative backend is greatly improved</li>
</ul>
