<p>Need I say more? This is from a cookie-cutter Wordpress site with some flash mixed in with a template. The flash was only added to make a little transitional animation for the navigation bar.</p>
<p>HTML5, and heck, even CSS3 or simple JavaScript (using jQuery) would enable the above-mentioned site to quickly and easily enable the same animations and transitions, using only a few hundred bytes of code. Seeing that jQuery was already loaded on the site, it makes a heck of a lot more sense than using Flash.</p>
<p>We need to educate web designers on how they can break free from their Flash comfort zone, save a few hundred bucks in software licenses every year, and make their websites load two to three times faster (not to mention, more quickly and without requiring buggy third party extensions).</p>
<p>95% of Flash use is avoidable and unnecessary, in my opinion.</p>
