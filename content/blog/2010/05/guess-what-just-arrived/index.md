<p>It&#39;s my semi-annual love affair with the world&#39;s best SLR. Plus, a hefty but amazing 70-200mm VR zoom lens (it&#39;s the older model, but still incredible). I get to use this killer combo, along with a Canon 5D mark II (what a combo!), every year for deacon and priesthood ordinations. My poor D90 gets left home alone. I hope it doesn&#39;t perform any shenanigans.</p>
