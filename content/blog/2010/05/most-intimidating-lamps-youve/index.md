<p>I don&#39;t think I would mess around in someone&#39;s home if I noticed these guys lighting up the place. I imagine if someone could afford a solid gold lamp in the shape of an M4 Carbine, a Glock, or an MP5, they could probably afford to hire a guard carrying the same to shoot anyone attempting robbery.</p>
