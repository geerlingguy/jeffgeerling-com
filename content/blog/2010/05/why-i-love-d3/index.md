<p>I was simply running and gunning around my condo in very dim lighting this evening, and I am continually amazed at the sharpness, the clarity, and the beautiful colors that come out of the D3. Granted, pairing it with the amazing Nikon 50mm f/1.4 is much akin to pairing cream and a doughnut... but still:</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./nikon-d3-3200-1_4.jpg" alt="Nikon D3 at ISO 3200" width="640" height="427" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
<p>ISO 3200, extremely dim lighting, Nikkor 50mm f/1.4 @ 1.4, 1/40 second exposure (!)</p>
<p>I tried the same picture with the D90, and not only could I not get critical focus (it was hard to get it to focus on the central chain without guessing and moving forward/backward between shots), but even when I was close, there was nowhere near the sharpness or clarity afforded by the D3&#39;s FX-size sensor.</p>
<p>I have one word for the D3: <em>want</em>.</p>
