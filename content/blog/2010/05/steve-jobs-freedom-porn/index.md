<p>[UPDATE: Looks like <a href="http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2010/may/10051811.html">LifeSiteNews is corroborating this news</a>...]</p>
<p>Interesting snippet from an <a href="http://gawker.com/5539717/">email exchange between Steve Jobs and Ryan Tate</a> (from Gawker Media):</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./porn-steve-jobs.png" alt="Steve Jobs on pornography" width="517" height="336" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
<p>While Steve and I might not agree on many things, his (well, Apple&#39;s) philosophy on porn has been pretty awesome so far: they&#39;ll have none of it... or at least almost.</p>
<p>The App store is happily void of the smut that covers all corners of the Internet. And Apple&#39;s OS X, iPhone, iTunes Store, etc. all have relatively robust <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/01/13/kid-proofing-a-mac-with-parental-controls/">Parental Controls</a> as compared to most other devices/services. Apple could do better, but I think Steve might be pretty solid in his stance that pornography is not a good thing for &#39;freedom&#39; and &#39;openness.&#39; Rather, it&#39;s a crime against human sexuality.</p>
<p>Those of us who are the digital curators of the Internet should help stamp out pornography. Programs like <a href="http://archstl.org/my-house">My House</a> are cropping up in the Church to help with this problem on a family level, but we all need to double our efforts to get rid of this societal scourge!</p>
