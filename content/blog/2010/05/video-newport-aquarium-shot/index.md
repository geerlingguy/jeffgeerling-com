<p>The video below is a montage of clips from Newport Aquarium in Newport, KY. I finally had some time to compile the clips, and back them with some ethereal music I had sitting on my drive. The video includes some jellyfish (even a tiny one that lights up its back somehow), turtles, coral reef plants, and a few other fish, big and small. All clips were recorded with my Nikon D90 at 720p, with a 50mm f/1.4 lens (it was DARK in there!).</p>
