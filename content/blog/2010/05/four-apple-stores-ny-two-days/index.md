<p>It is said that, during a jubilee year, one would <a href="http://www.roma2000.it/zhomebas.html">receive a plenary indulgence by visiting all four major basilicas</a> in Rome (nowadays, it seems you only have to visit one of them&mdash;pfft!).</p>
<p>During this Apple Jubilee of 2010, I have visited all four of the Major Apple Stores in New York City (my total Apple Store visit count is about 25 now) in two days... I didn&#39;t buy anything, so I might&#39;ve missed one of the conditions of the plenary Apple-dulgence, but I did get my photo taken by an Apple employee!</p>
<h3>Apple Store - Upper West Side</h3>
<p>Entering into the Upper West Side Apple Store feels like entering a major train terminal or union station; the space is HUGE, with a ton of vertical space. It was fairly chilly inside, and I wonder how much money they spend on air conditioning and heating the place!</p>

(Eek! Not very flattering, I know)...</p>

<h3>Apple Store - West 14th Street</h3>
<p>This was the most unique Apple Store experience I&#39;ve had so far; not only is there an amazing glass spiral staircase, the building looks almost like an old printery or newspaper mill&mdash;very unlike most other Apple buiding fa&ccedil;ades.</p>

<h3>Apple Store - Soho</h3>
<p>This store is almost identical in layout to the Chicagoland Apple Store I visited a few months ago, except the back end of the store extends an additional 30 ft. or so.</p>

<h3>Apple Store - 5th Avenue</h3>
<p>The elevator at this store is unique in that it is driven only by a single piston, and has no cables on the top of the car. I can imagine there&#39;s quite a bit of weight on that metal piston! As usual, there is an overabundance of three-ply glass panels... <em>everywhere</em>.</p>

<p>Thanks especially to my fianc&eacute;e, who encouraged me to enter into each Apple Store, even though I felt unworthy at times.</p>
