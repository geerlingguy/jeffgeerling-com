<p><em><a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/geerlingguy/catholic-programmers-t">Reposted from Open Source Catholic</a>:</em></p>
<p>A few weeks back, after finishing a full day of swimming in PHP, HTML and CSS, I was pondering the great mystery of human existence, but probably had a little too much to drink. The result?</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./Catholic-Programming-Design.png" alt="Catholic Programming - Design" class="imagecache-article-image-large blog-image" >}}</p>
<p>You can buy the design on the following products (via Zazzle):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/catholic_programmers_t_shirt-235497535568718849">Catholic Programmer&#39;s T-Shirt</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/catholic_programmers_mousepad-144670862553300061">Catholic Programmer&#39;s Mousepad</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Would you like the design on anything else? I could do a mug, or socks, or anything else in Zazzle&#39;s catalog...</p>
<p>Alternatively, can you think of a way to code this better? ;-)</p>
