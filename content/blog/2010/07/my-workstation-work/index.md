<p>Here&#39;s an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/3088787766/">older shot from my previous setup</a> at home (much has changed since then... but most things are the same&mdash;in principle! The core tenets of a Geerling computer workstation are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Multiple Macs.</li>
<li>One of the Macs must have at least a 24&quot; display.</li>
<li>Complexity (like messy cables) should be hidden as much as possible.</li>
<li>Screen real estate trumps everything else.</li>
</ol>
