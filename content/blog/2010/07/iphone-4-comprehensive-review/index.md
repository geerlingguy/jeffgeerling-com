<blockquote class="tldr"><strong>tl;dr</strong>: The iPhone 4 is another great step forward from Apple. From the dazzling quality of the built-in camera and respective app, to the brilliance of the Retina display, this iPhone is an all-around winner.</blockquote>

<p>After having tried an iPhone 4 display model at my local Apple Store, and tasting the Retina display kool-aid, I couldn&#39;t wait until my pre-ordered unit finally came in. Well, it did, and I have to say that one day&#39;s use has already impressed me enough to look on older iPhones with some amount of disgust. How could I have possibly coped with the low-resolution display, grainy camera, and rather sluggish upload speeds on the 3G and 3Gs?</p>

<h3>Audio Quality</h3>
<p>I have experienced great clarity in calls on my iPhone 4, both on my and the receiver&#39;s end. This is likely due to the fact that the iPhone 4 now has a noise-cancellation microphone on top, which helps to filter out background and static noise while on a call.</p>
<p>The speaker (for speakerphone or listening to music out loud) is on-par with my iPhone 3Gs, and the earpiece is about the same, too.</p>
<p>Everything else is about the same as the iPhone 3G/3Gs. Nothing much to report here.</p>
<h3>Antenna Issues</h3>
<p>None to report, so far. A lot of people have made a large amount of noise over this issue... and I can replicate the odd problem of signal loss when holding the iPhone 4 a certain way... but (a) this has not been a problem for me so far in one day&#39;s use, and (b) it has only happened in a few different places. At home, I can&#39;t replicate the problem. Go figure.</p>
<h3>Retina Display</h3>

<p>Gorgeous. Need I say more? You really, really really have to see one in-person to appreciate it. No picture viewed on your computer (or any other current LCD, LED, or CRT display) can possibly do the Retina display&#39;s quality and sharpness justice.</p>
<h3>Camera Quality (Stills)</h3>
<p>I am what may be called a reluctant amateur photographer. Reluctant, because I really wish I could be a professional. Amateur, because I have neither the time nor the equipment required to be a true &#39;professional.&#39; However, I have been privileged to shoot with pro cameras and lenses on multiple occasions, and I have (in my opinion) very high standards for &#39;keeper&#39; photos (photos that aren&#39;t immediately trashed after importing into Aperture).</p>
<p>Since purchasing the <a href="/review/photography/canon-powershot-g11-digital">Canon PowerShot G11</a>, I have been using it as a walkaround camera during short trips, family parties, and similar occasions (rather than carrying around my <a href="/review/photography/nikon-d90-slr-review">Nikon D90</a> + lenses/flashes). I have always been one to consolidate, though, and as soon as the iPhone came out, I ditched my old Palm m505 PDA and separate cell phone. But camera phones have never been good enough to let me set down my point and shoot. Until now.</p>

(Click on the image above to view the original, slightly color-corrected image).</p>
<p>This iPhone takes gorgeous pictures in good lighting. Even the background is exposed pretty well, even if there&#39;s some image noise. I&#39;m extremely glad Apple&#39;s following Canon and Nikon&#39;s lead, and focusing on per-pixel image quality rather than megapixel insanity. While other companies are pushing tiny 1/10&quot; sensors to 6, 8 or 10 megapixels, Apple increased the size of the camera sensor and stuck with 5 megapixels, so images retain pretty good image quality.</p>
<p>While not noise-free, like an ISO 80 shot on my G11 in good lighting (or, heck, ISO 400 on my D90!), the iPhone produces <em>perfectly</em> acceptable shots in most situations. Meaning I have one less digital device to lug around!</p>
<p>I also tested the iPhone in almost pitch-black lighting&mdash;the image below was taken using only the light from a fireworks display:</p>

(Click the picture to view original, untouched image).</p>
<p>Two other things that allow me to use the iPhone as a walkaround camera: almost zero shutter lag, and a pretty quick shutter speed&mdash;I can take maybe 1.2 pictures per second - almost as good as my G11 (but nowhere near the nice 11 pictures/second of the Nikon D3 I love so much).</p>
<h3>Camera Quality (HD Video)</h3>
<p>For the past few years, I tried my hand at shooting video on my Nikon D90 (it shoots in 720p HD with a mono mic, but has few adjustments/controls), but found it much too cumbersome. The iPhone almost matches my D90&#39;s HD video quality (at least, in typical situations... I can&#39;t put a 50mm&nbsp;f/1.4 on the iPhone to get a beautiful depth-of-field effect!), and is in my pocket.</p>
<p>[Related: See my blog post on <a href="/blog/2010/iphone-4-external-mic-audio">using external mics with the iPhone 4&#39;s Camera app</a>].</p>
<p>See the video below, which was completely shot and edited in iMovie on the iPhone:</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/xEG0qvjflhM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="340" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/xEG0qvjflhM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560"></embed></object><br />
(Click through to YouTube or click the HD button to see the 720p video quality).</p>
<p>A bonus feature of the video mode is that you can turn on the included LED light and use it as a flashlight&mdash;a very, very bright flashlight that gets noticeably warm after about 5 minutes of use! But this is much nicer than using the front screen of the iPhone for the purpose. I hope a good flashlight app (one that simply turns on the LED when the app is opened) is released soon!</p>
<h3>Other Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The phone feels great in the hand, and fits a few of my old iPhone 3Gs accessories. Unfortunately, a lot of my old accessories were molded for the 3G/3Gs, so I can&#39;t transfer them to the new iPhone 4.</li>
<li>All my apps are working great on the new iPhone 4, but a few of the icons, and many in-app graphics/icons look pixelated&nbsp;on the otherwise-gorgeous Retina display.</li>
<li>The new iPhone 4 dock is rather annoying in that it has a small slit of plastic that <em>very</em> slightly encumbers the use of the iPhone in-dock. The 3G/3Gs dock let your finger run over the entire surface of the iPhone. Not a huge deal, though; just an annoyance.</li>
<li>Both the front and back now need a shirt-wiping every day (at a minimum). They&#39;ll both pick up your smudges pretty easily. I might invest in a thin case for this iPhone... I don&#39;t particularly like the bumpers Apple offers (especially at $29).</li>
<li>The sleep/wake button and volume up/down buttons are much more solid and easy to use. However, I&#39;m not a huge fan of the metal silent/ring switch - it now requires a fingernail to activate (unlike the 3G/3Gs). Another minor annoyance...</li>
</ul>

The iPhone 4 can be purchased used for around <span itemprop="price">$200</span> as of 2013.
