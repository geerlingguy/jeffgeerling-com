<p><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a> was great. It was <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, with a little more speed, better tabs, and a cool status bar that would only show when it needed to.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m switching back, for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Safari 5.0 is just as fast as Chrome.</li>
<li>Safari&#39;s tab system is nicer looking than Chrome. Not a biggie.</li>
<li>Safari can read PDFs without opening up an external application, and without downloading it to your Downloads folder. I hate having to clear out my Downloads folder every day after inadvertently clicking on PDF links (who uses PDFs anyways? ;-).</li>
<li>When you right-click on an element in Safari (anywhere on the page), and click &#39;Inspect Element,&#39; it works correctly. In Chrome, if you do this to an element under where the Inspector shows, the inspector shows an overview of the html structure...</li>
<li>Safari allows you to set a default page for new windows/tabs/etc. Chrome requires an extension to do the same, and it doesn&#39;t work as well.</li>
<li>Safari has Reader. Awesome. Instant Instapaper.</li>
<li>Safari&#39;s recent page gallery view is much nicer than Chrome&#39;s recent pages view.</li>
<li>Safari lets you drag URLs straight from the URL bar to the desktop (or any app that supports files being dragged to it), creating a link file. Chrome doesn&#39;t.</li>
<li>Safari has a built-in RSS reader that beats the heck out of any Chrome RSS extension.</li>
<li>Safari is a Mac OS X first-class application. Chrome is always lagging on the Mac platform, behind its <span class="Apple-style-span" style="white-space: nowrap;">Windows counterpart.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The only ridiculously awesome thing Chrome has that Safari doesn&#39;t is the ability to search straight from the &#39;magic bar&#39; or whatever Google calls it. <strike><a href="http://alexstaubo.github.com/keywurl/">Keywurl</a> used to support this, but I&#39;m not sure if it works with Safari 5... maybe there&#39;s an extension I can use somewhere.</strike>&nbsp;Nevermind. Keywurl works great with Safari 5, as long as you follow <a href="http://hacketal.com/making-keywurl-work-with-safari-5">these directions for editing Keywurl&#39;s&nbsp;info.plist file</a>.</p>
<p>Another minor quibble is that Safari can crash altogether due to one page crashing... Chrome opens a new process for each tab, which is a nice feature.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll still use Chrome as my &#39;anonymous user&#39; browser, but Safari takes the cake for beauty and efficiency. For now.</p>
<p>(Some might ask why I don&#39;t use FireFox... I say it&#39;s way too slow for anything except, ironically, YSlow).</p>
