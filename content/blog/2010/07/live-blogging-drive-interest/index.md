<p>Check out my post, <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/geerlingguy/live-blogging-drive">Live-Blogging to Drive Traffic, Interest to Organizational Events</a>, on Open Source Catholic. From the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Steubenville St. Louis Mid-America conference is attended by over 6,000 teens every year, and there are many parents, friends, and other teens who wish they could participate as well. We have always posted information after the conference, but in St. Louis, for the past two years, we&#39;ve started live-blogging and posting to social networks frequently throughout the conference, driving up traffic to our OYM websites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had triple the number of visitors this year than we had last year, and the residual traffic for this event is pretty strong, and keeps up interest for the event throughout the year.</p>
