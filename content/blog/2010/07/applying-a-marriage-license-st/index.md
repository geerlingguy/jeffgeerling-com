<p>Finding guidelines for acquiring a marriage license in St. Louis County is somewhat a pain in the rear. Because it&#39;s a convoluted mess of links to get to the information you need, I thought I&#39;d put it a little more succinctly, for those who, like me, just want to get it over with...</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bride + Groom must appear in person (at same time) at the Recorders of Deeds Office in Clayton</strong> (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;q=41+South+Central+Avenue+Clayton,+MO+63105-1799&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=41+S+Central+Ave,+Clayton,+St+Louis,+Missouri+63105&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=L8FFTJjLOorM9gTN3az3CQ&amp;ved=0CBMQ8gEwAA&amp;z=16">map</a>). (The marriage license office is on the 4th floor of the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="white-space: nowrap;">County Government Building.</span>
<ol>
<li>You must both be 18, and have a government-issued photo ID. Blood tests are not required for a license. Must also provide proof of Social Security Number (SSN).</li>
<li>Marriage license application is $45. You can get a copy of the license for $1.</li>
<li>You must use the Marriage License within 30 days after its issuance.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>The bride may change her name</strong> at the Missouri Department of Revenue (for driver&#39;s license) and the Social Security offices.
<ol>
<li>She can use a certified copy of her marriage license for this purpose.</li>
<li>Copies of the marriage license: $2 for photocopy; $9 for certified copy; $10 for authenticated copy.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/locator/">Find your local Social Security Office &raquo;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dor.mo.gov/mvdl/offloc/cgi-bin/offloc.cgi?search1=county&amp;County=St.+Louis+County&amp;Submit=Submit">St. Louis County License Office locations (DoR) &raquo;</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Still rather convoluted, but at least you can do this all in a couple of days, most likely. Getting a name change everywhere else is a pain in the rear, though (bank, Church, forums, etc.).</p>
