<p>I recently visited the <a href="http://www.sacredhearteureka.org/">Church of the Most Sacred Heart</a> in Eureka, MO, and took many photos of the interior (<a href="/photos/galleries/most-sacred-heart-catholic">view a full gallery of the pictures I took</a>). The standout photos of the bunch were of the stained glass windows. Below are the three patronal saints of the Archdiocese of St. Louis (depicted on the left side of the Church, when sitting in the main body of the pews).</p>

<p>Even though this Church was recently renovated, it has a very strong style of &#39;noble simplicity&#39; - the Church is of a traditional cruciform layout, but the stained glass is very well made, and most of the liturgical instruments (candle stands, the altar, the tabernacle, etc.) are beautifully restored or newly crafted. The Church even features a beautiful (and functional) pipe organ in the rear choir loft!</p>
