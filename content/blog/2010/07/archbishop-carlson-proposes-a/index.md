<p>From the St. Louis Review&#39;s story, <a href="http://stlouisreview.com/article/2010-07-28/archbishop-carlson-stanislaus-offer">Archbishop Carlson makes an offer to the parishioners of St. Stanislaus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to help get the parish re-established, <strong>I have committed that the archdiocese would provide the pastor for the first year of the reestablished parish without cost to the parish and would contribute up to $10,000</strong> to pay the cost of the consultant for a fund drive to secure the finances of the parish corporation and the St. Stanislaus Corporation for the future.</p>
<p>This proposal has my full support and I will do everything in my power to make St. Stanislaus succeed as a personal parish for Catholics of Polish heritage.</p>
<p>I ask that you please join me in praying that reconciliation can be brought about and, with the help of God, healing will take place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as with Archbishop Burke before, Archbishop Carlson seems to be willing to go to very great lengths to ensure the Catholicity of this once great parish&mdash;let us pray that this situation gets resolved sooner rather than later!</p>
