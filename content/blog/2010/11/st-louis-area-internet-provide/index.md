<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./charter-att-clear-logos.jpg" alt="Charter, AT&amp;T and Clear - Logos" width="588" height="65" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
<p>For the past eight years, I&#39;ve been bouncing back and forth from one ISP to another, trying to find one that actually feels worth the load of money I pay for it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve used a variety of services from both of the main St. Louis area providers (<a href="http://www.att.com/gen/general?pid=6431"><strong>AT&amp;T</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.charter.com/internet"><strong>Charter Communications</strong></a>), and am testing <a href="http://www.clear.com/"><strong>Clear</strong></a> wireless (a new game in town, but one that&#39;s been around in Chicago and other larger cities for a year or more). I&#39;ve paid anywhere from $15/month to $90/month (for Internet service alone&mdash;I&#39;ve never participated in the &#39;Charter Bundle,&#39; &#39;Uverse&#39; or any voice/data/video bundles).</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to go through the reasons why I&#39;ve tried all the different services, and what I&#39;ve liked&mdash;and hated&mdash;about each. As a prelude, I am still not pleased with the performance I&#39;ve received from any of the providers (at least, not for what I&#39;m paying/have paid!).</p>
<h3>AT&amp;T &#39;High Speed&#39; DSL</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve tried AT&amp;T&#39;s DSL service in three different parts of St. Louis: North county, the Central West End, and Shrewsbury. In all three areas, I&#39;ve encountered the same problem&mdash;an unreliable connection.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been through many support calls, and in all cases, when a technician is sent out, he says the line signal is perfect. Go figure. I&#39;ve used a few different modems, some rather expensive, and they&#39;ve all exhibited these problems.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>The unreliable connection is inconvenient, but the slow speeds are the worst part of the equation. You&#39;d expect that, if you can purchase Uverse and get 24 Mbps, why is there no option for regular DSL at that speed... or Uverse with only Internet service? I&#39;d be willing to pay for it, so that&#39;s not the issue... I just want raw speed.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;ve always been limited to 6 Mbps down, and 1-2 Mbps up, which is acceptable, but can feel pretty slow sometimes. When the connection is live, the speed is always pretty stable, which is a plus.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T&#39;s customer support is worse than abysmal, and getting an actual human on the phone or online is a bit of a challenge. When canceling my account (both times), I had a lot better support, and they were all but falling over themselves with flattery.</p>
<h3>Charter Communications High Speed Internet</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve tried Charter Internet both in the Central West End and in Shrewsbury, and my experiences have varied quite dramatically. The first time I tried Charter, I cancelled after about three months, because no matter how many cables I tried, no matter how much I babied the modem, the connection would never remain stable&mdash;this was inside a large apartment complex.</p>
<p>The second time was/has been much improved, but is leaving a rather bad taste in my mouth. I&#39;m getting 10 Mbps reliably (I used to be on the 20 Mbps plan, until they jacked the price up double what I was originally paying), and the connection only seems to drop out once every month.</p>
<p>I have two huge problems, though, with Charter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Their customer support&mdash;with the exception of support via Twitter (more on that in a sec)&mdash;is abysmal... and it&#39;s even more challenging to talk to a knowledgable person at Charter than it is at AT&amp;T.</li>
<li>Any time my connection is flaky or drops, they want to send a technician... and not today, but maybe a week or so from today. What the heck? I was paying for their most expensive Internet plan, and they wanted me to have a full 25% of a month without service? No thanks.</li>
</ol>
<p>The redeeming grace of Charter (besides the speed, for which you pay) is their service via one of their Twitter accounts. They have a great service called <a href="http://myaccount.charter.com/customers/support.aspx?supportarticleid=2260">Umatter2Charter</a>, which is basically a team of Charter support staff who prowl Twitter for #Charter topics, and respond to customers with problems.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, after having spent over an hour on the phone with a Charter support rep, unplugging and replugging my modem, turning on and off my computer (<a href="http://xkcd.com/806/">wowee, like that&#39;s going to help</a>... I have a Mac! ;-), etc., a Twitter support rep took only 3 minutes to respond to my DM with &quot;it looks like your line is having a pretty bad upstream SNR&quot; (Signal to Noise Ratio). I moved the modem to another cable connection, and replace the cable, and voila! It worked again (but for how long...).</p>
<p>So, Charter&mdash;you have a great opportunity to impress me by making your support options over the phone or via live chat as good as your Twitter team. I&#39;m literally *this close* to discontinuing my service. I might as well, since my price is through the roof.</p>
<h3>Clear Wireless - 4G Wireless Service</h3>
<p>Clear Wireless uses a new &#39;4G&#39; network, which is like the 3G I can get and share on my iPhone 4 using MyWi, but faster :-)</p>
<p>The service starts around $30-40/month, and I signed up for the simple personal hotspot, as I would like to use it not only around the house, but also at work, at friends&#39; houses, etc.</p>
<p>The biggest issues with Clear is the fact that (a) they&#39;re a new game in town, and haven&#39;t yet proven themselves reliable/a good long-term solution, and (b) the signal is, at times, so finicky, that it can take longer to find a good spot for the modem than I actually need the signal.</p>
<p>In many buildings, the hotspot only works on one side of the building, so the signal coverage from cell towers is obviously not saturating like the 3G signal I get on my iPhone, which gives 3-5 bars almost anywhere I go (even inside thick concrete buildings).</p>
<p>At my condo, there&#39;s a little sweet spot on my window sill where I can reliably get 3-5 Mbps down, and the maximum 1 Mbps up, but getting power to the modem is a chore, since I have to run an extension cable over there (tacky, I know).</p>
<p>Once Clear gets more towers running, I think they&#39;ll be more able to compete with the reliability and speed (for the price) of Charter and AT&amp;T. For now, the Clear spot is still a fun diversion for me. (In a few areas of St. Louis, I was getting 12 to 14 Mbps down!).</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So, who am I sticking with?</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s a funny question. I just ordered AT&amp;T Elite DSL yesterday because they&#39;re running a special - $20/month for a year. I still have my Charter $65/month 10 Mbps Cable, and I have my 0-12 Mbps Clear hotspot sitting on my desk.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Charter</strong> is the best option for pure speed and (maybe, depending on your neighborhood) reliability.</li>
<li><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> is best if you want Uverse with TV, Phone and Internet (but who does that nowadays? TV? Either buy a $2 antenna and get it OTA, or watch things on Hulu). And buy a mobile phone.</li>
<li><strong>Clear</strong> is looking very promising&mdash;they just need more signal saturation, and a little better price. I&#39;m cheering for them, but can&#39;t yet declare them a winner.</li>
</ul>
