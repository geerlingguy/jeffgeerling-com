<p>The new Blue Mikey (2.0) will not work with the iPhone 4 or iPad. It&#39;s a big letdown for me, as I don&#39;t really care if Blue can support previous-generation or outmoded equipment with their mics.</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./blue-mikey.jpg" alt="Blue Mikey 2.0" width="88" height="84" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
<p>Their CEO, John Maier (no... not John Mayer...) said <a href="http://www.bluemic.com/mikeyforipod/#/desc/">their engineers are hard at work</a> increasing compatibility with iPhone 4 and iPad. Great. Maybe we&#39;ll see the Mikey 3.0 next year sometime. I&#39;m not holding my breath.</p>
<p>I guess I&#39;ll stick to <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/articles/photography/iphone-4-ipad-external-mic-audio-input">my own setup for recording audio on the iPhone 4</a>. I was really hoping this Mikey revision would allow me to leave all my cables and mics behind, and stick with the Mikey alone, but that&#39;s not the case.</p>
<p><em>Technically speaking, the Mikey is made &#39;for iPod&#39; - but why doesn&#39;t Blue see the massive potential for selling a professional audio recording device for the iPhone. Judging by the huge amount of traffic I get on my iPhone recording series, they&#39;d get a bit of business.</em></p>
