<p>A few notes from my initial use of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00446GYUQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmjjg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00446GYUQ">Plextor PX-B120U external USB BD-ROM</a>{{< figure src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mmjjg-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00446GYUQ" width="1" height="1" >}} drive (you can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00446GYUQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmjjg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00446GYUQ">pick it up for under $100!</a>{{< figure src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mmjjg-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00446GYUQ" width="1" height="1" >}}):</p>

<li>You need to plug the drive directly into your Mac, or use a USB hub capable of providing enough juice to power the device directly. Since the Plextor drive doesn't actually have an AC adapter, it needs all its juice through the USB port. (I was trying to plug it into my weak Belkin USB hub, and that wasn't working).</li>
<li>You can use the drive with VMWare Fusion, but it seems you need Windows Vista or Windows 7 to be able to actually do anything besides read DVDs or CDs with the drive.</li>
<li>I don't have Windows 7 (yet), so I can't yet test how well a new iMac can play back Blu-Ray discs using the included CyberLink PowerDVD 9 BD.</li>
<li>I am evaluating <a href="http://www.makemkv.com/download/">MakeMKV</a> (a native BD/DVD ripper for the Mac) to see if it will be able to do <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/articles/computing/convert-high-definition-movies-to-quicktime">what I did for my HD-DVD collection</a>—back everything up in full HD, including the surround sound tracks (I'm okay with Dolby Digital 5.1...)</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll post back here with any new updates I find.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>[<strong>Update</strong>: MakeMKV is absolutely amazing - it takes a while to rip all the tracks off a Blu-Ray to disk (heck, just copying 20+ GB of data on any medium takes a while), but once finished, the MKV plays well in VLC, and you can use Handbrake to convert the MKV to an iTunes/iPhone/iPad/AppleTV/Xbox 360-compatible MPEG-4 video file (.mp4 or .m4v).</p>
<p>Update 2: Also check out my latest article on Lifeisaprayer.com: <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/articles/audio-and-video/2010/ripping-movies-blu-ray-and-dvd"><strong>Ripping Movies from Blu-Ray and DVD</strong>, Getting them onto Apple TV, iPad, iPhone, etc.</a></p>
<p>Awesome.]</p>
