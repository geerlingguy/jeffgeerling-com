<p>I would like to extend a very heartfelt congratulations to now-Bishop-designate Edward M. Rice, who will be ordained as the new Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of St. Louis on January 13!</p>
<p>Bishop-designate Rice is a very cheerful, fun, and friendly priest who is faithful, prayerful, and loving of all the people entrusted to his spiritual/pastoral leadership. I have had the honor of working with him from time to time as he has helped at Kenrick-Glennon Seminary and in his role as the Vocations Director for the Archdiocese of St. Louis, and I&#39;m glad that I&#39;ll be able to work with him as the soon-to-be Auxiliary Bishop!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a photo I shot of him for a Vocational Discernment pamphlet last year (it&#39;s on Flickr - click to view larger sizes):</p>
