<p>After about a week&#39;s use of Reeder for Mac (currently at &#39;Draft 4&#39; status), I can finally ditch NetNewsWire, and confidently state that I would pay maybe something like $20 for this new Mac application.</p>
<p>NetNewsWire has always been a little slow, a little clunky, but at least it was reliable.</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./reeder-screenshot.png" alt="Reeder for Mac - Draft 4" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
<p class="rteleft">Reeder brings a lot of the simplicity of the iOS Reeder apps (both of which I have - <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder-for-ipad/id375661689?mt=8">Reeder for iPad</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id325502379?mt=8">Reeder for iPhone</a>) to desktop Macs. There are some <a href="http://danielkennett.org/blog/2010/12/analysing-a-touch-to-desktop-ui-port-using-fitts-law-reeder/">odd UI glitches</a> that are simple annoyances, but don&#39;t get in the way of my personal use of the app.</p>
<p>However, every new draft release brings with it more goodies, more polish, and more awesomesauce.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite key commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong>, then <strong>Enter</strong> - Marks all stories as read, and clears them out of the Unread view.</li>
<li><strong>R</strong> - Refresh. Simple, and no command key needed!</li>
<li><strong>Up/Down</strong> or <strong>K/J</strong> - Previous/next item</li>
<li><strong>B</strong> - View in browser (can configure to pop-behind in preferences)</li>
</ul>
