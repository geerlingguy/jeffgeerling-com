<p>Packt publishing just announced earlier this morning that <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> has won the 2009 Open Source PHP CMS award!</p>
<blockquote>Packt Publishing is pleased to announce that Drupal has won the Best Open Source PHP CMS Category in the 2009 Open Source CMS Award. This category featured a very close contest between the top three, Drupal, WordPress, and Joomla! in which Drupal ended up as the overall choice for the judges and the public.</blockquote>
<p>Joomla was the second place winner (kudos to them as well!); read <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/drupal-wins-2009-best-open-source-php-cms">the original release here</a>.</p>
<p>With <a href="http://buytaert.net/whitehouse-gov-using-drupal">Drupal being used on Whitehouse.gov</a>, <a href="http://buytaert.net/att-using-drupal">AT&amp;T's mobile apps website</a>, and countless other corporate sites and subsites, it's a good time to be in the Open Source arena!</p>
