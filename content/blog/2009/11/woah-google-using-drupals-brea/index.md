<p>It would seem <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/new-site-hierarchies-display-in-search.html">Google has rolled out a new indexing/display feature</a> that finds breadcrumbs and displays them instead of URLs for certain search results. Drupal's already game, it seems, judging by numerous searches I've taken a glance at today:</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./drupal-seo-google-search-results.png" alt="Drupal's Breadcrumb-enabled Search Results" width="547" height="86" >}}</p>
<p class="rteleft">I guess since Drupal's built towards this kind of data heirarchy, Google quickly and easily indexes the breadcrumbs... any other sites/CMSs already in the index in this manner?</p>
<p class="rteleft">Also, I wonder what this will do in terms of eye tracking and such - the first time I noticed it, my eye went to the URL immediately - of course, that could just be due to the novelty of the thing.</p>
