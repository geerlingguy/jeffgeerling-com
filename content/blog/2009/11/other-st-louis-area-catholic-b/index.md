[UPDATE: I've posted a more comprehensive guide that I intend to keep updated here: <a href="/articles/religion/2011/st-louis-area-catholic-blogger">St. Louis-area Catholic Bloggers/Websites</a>].

I've come to the realization that many St. Louis-area Catholics have no idea how many excellent blogs are published by other Catholics in the area. Here are the ones I know of - feel free to leave a link to any that I've missed in the comments below.

<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.archstl.org/">Archdiocese of Saint Louis</a></strong>

Obviously the main source of information for Archdiocesan events. I hear they're getting a site upgrade soon... more to come ;-)</li>
	<li><a href="http://stlouiscatholic.blogspot.com/"><strong>Saint Louis Catholic</strong></a>

A great blog about timely news in the Archdiocese, with a bit of a traditional slant. Often uses colorful and entertaining language when discussing the current state of affairs.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.romeofthewest.com/"><strong>Rome of the West</strong></a>

Blog by a Catholic photographer and explorer who has also helped with the publication of books highlighting the Catholic heritage of the Archdiocese of St. Louis. Many beautiful photos from in and around St. Louis can be found on this blog!</li>
	<li><a href="http://aeternus.stblogs.com/"><strong>Aeternus</strong></a>

This blog has a more spiritual nature, and looks gorgeous (especially in its simplicity). It's nice to have in the feed reader for an occasional reflective post.</li>
	<li><a href="http://soilcatholics.blogspot.com/"><strong>Southern Illinois Catholic</strong></a>

This blog often reflects on the current political climate, liturgical advancements, and general Catholic goings-on in and around St. Louis and the Metro East.</li>
	<li><a href="http://slatts.blogspot.com/"><strong>Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam</strong></a>

Blog about Archdiocesan events, politics, and culture. Updated regularly.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.stlyouth.org/blogs"><strong>OYM&nbsp;Blogs</strong></a>

Blog posts from many individuals involved in St. Louis Archdiocesan youth ministry. Topics include humor, spirituality, prayer, youth ministry, sexuality, and the Church.</li>
	<li><a href="http://viewfrombackpew.blogspot.com/"><strong>Snup's View from the Back Pew</strong></a>

A very timely blog, where the author travels to a new parish within the Archdiocese every week and gives, quite literally, a 'view from the back pew' (along with some observations about the liturgy). Definitely worth subscribing, especially since you can&nbsp;essentially take an online pilgrimage to the parishes in the Archdiocese!</li>
	<li><a href="http://thankevann.com/homeschoolgoodies/"><strong>Homeschool Goodies</strong></a>

Great blog about homeschooling run by a homeschooling mom from Northwest St. Louis County.</li>
	<li><a href="http://catholicpublius.blogspot.com/"><strong>The Forum</strong></a>

A blog by a local young adult with excellent and timely analysis of political news from around the St. Louis region, around the U.S., and around the world.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.archstl.org/missions/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=0&amp;Itemid=400"><strong>Archdiocese of St. Louis' Mission Blog</strong></a>

Run by the staff and other contributors in the Mission Office for the Archdiocese.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://weneedfaithhopeandcharity.blogspot.com/">We Need Faith, Hope &amp; Charity</a></strong>

Blog about saints and relevant situations facing Catholics today.</li>
</ul>

Any blogs I'm missing?&nbsp;Please add them below - I'd like to try to have St. Louis area Catholic bloggers a little more in-touch, instead of operating as little islands of Catholic bloggyness. Having a list of all the blogs would help this effort.

[EDIT] Here are some more blogs suggested by others:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://politickles.com/blog/"><strong>Politickles</strong></a>: Conservative, Catholic, political and humorous.</li>
	<li><a href="http://principiumunitatis.blogspot.com/"><strong>Principium Unitatis</strong></a>: A blog dedicated to the reunification of all Christian churches.</li>
</ul>
