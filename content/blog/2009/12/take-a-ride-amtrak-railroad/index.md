<p>
	For the first time since I was a child, I took an Amtrak train rather than drive or fly to another city. I&#39;m currently in Chicago, and the Amtrak ride was a rather uneventful five hours, with many laughing and talking individuals sitting around me&hellip; luckily, I had my iPhone and headphones, so I could drown out a lot of that noise!</p>
<p>
	The train ride was pretty nice, I would say&mdash;there were few stops, the ride was extremely quiet (besides some track noise, and the occasional train horn), and besides some side-to-side jolting (which doesn&#39;t feel as frightening as rough turbulence, the ride was very pleasant. The price was nice, too: $23 one-way to Chicago (for the 4:30 a.m. Lincoln Express).</p>
<p>
	The train cars themselves are about equivalent to a charter bus, with a little more legroom, and one amenity that was extremely awesome: every seat had two 120V electrical outlets! I could keep my work-provided power-hungry 15&quot; MacBook Pro quite happy the whole way to Chicago :-)</p>
<p>
	The train also included a snack car and dining car, both of which were restful until about the time we hit Springfield, IL (and then half the train filled in just a few minutes!). For about half an hour, I had a guy across the way talking loudly and very obnoxiously on his phone... but I drowned him out by watching some of the John Adams documentary film (which is excellent, bye the way).</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ll definitely consider the train again in the future&hellip; it costs less, is relaxing, and has some very nice travel amenities you can&#39;t find many other places.</p>
