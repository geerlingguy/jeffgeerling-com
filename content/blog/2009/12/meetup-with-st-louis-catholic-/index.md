<p>
	Earlier today, I had lunch with a few good (mostly online) friends at <a href="http://www.saucemagazine.com/rigazzis/">Rigazzi&#39;s on the Hill</a> (in St. Louis). The food was so-so, the company was great, and the atmosphere in the restaurant was pretty good. It&#39;s a little bit tucked away next to Kingshighway, but not too hard to find (plus there&#39;s plenty of parking in the area).</p>
<p>
	I met Snup (from&nbsp;<a href="http://viewfrombackpew.blogspot.com/">Snup&#39;s view from the back pew</a>) for the first time; she seems to have a most excellent plan in place for the rest of her parish visits. She&#39;s about 1/10 of the way through all the parishes in St. Louis, and she&#39;s chronicling her visits to various parishes on her blog (link above).</p>
<p>
	I also met (for the second time) Mark Scott Abeln, who takes many excellent pictures and writes for <a href="http://www.romeofthewest.com/">Rome of the West</a>, an excellent blog looking at the historical and architectural heritage of Saint Louis (with an emphasis on its Catholicity).</p>
<p>
	There are many other Catholic bloggers in the Saint Louis area whom I have not personally met, but would love to meet, at some point. I think it would be neat if we (St. Louis area Catholics who have an online presence) could get together for Mass and brunch, maybe once a year or once every few months. An intriguing idea to explore, certainly.</p>
