	From the Saint Louis Review this morning: <a href="http://stlouisreview.com/article/2009-12-27/pope-benedict-xvi-bes">Pope Benedict XVI Bestows Papal Honor on St. Louisan</a></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Pope Benedict XVI, has bestowed upon Dr. David Mueckl, PhD, DBA, the Papal Honor of Knight Commander with Star of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of Saint Gregory the Great.<br />
		<br />
		The Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great was established on September 1, 1831, by Pope Gregory XVI. It is one of the five pontifical orders of knighthood in the Catholic Church. As part of the reform of the Papal Orders instituted by Saint Pius X, in 1905 the grades of the Order were modified by the addition of a Star for a higher category of Knights Commander as well as assigning to the Papal Knights a particular place in Papal processions and in ceremonies of the Church.<br />
		<br />
		The order is bestowed on Catholic men and women (and in rare cases, non-Catholic men) in recognition of their service to the Church, unusual labors, support of the Holy See, and the good example set in their communities and country.</p>

	Having worked with Dr. Mueckl, I can attest to the fact that he is a worthy recipient of this honor, and I am proud to be a member of this Archdiocese, which supports and upholds many people who, in my estimation, are also great servants of the Church!</p>
