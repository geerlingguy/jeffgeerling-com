<p>
	As I was preparing for my return trip to St. Louis from Evanston, IL (I was at the <a href="http://www.drupalcampchicago.org/">DrupalCamp Chicago</a> this weekend), I realized I hadn&#39;t set up any way to get to the O&#39;Hare International Airport in order to board my American Airlines flight. Luckily, I looked up &#39;Evanston to O&#39;Hare&#39; online, and found a little nugget that many people don&#39;t know about.</p>
<p>
	There&#39;s a <a href="http://www.pacebus.com/sub/schedules/route_detail.asp?RouteNo=250">Pace bus (route 250)</a> that goes straight from downtown Evanston to the airport for a very nice $1.75! What&#39;s better, it only takes about an hour to get to the airport; taking the CTA or a combination of the Metra and CTA would take almost two hours, and cost at least three times as much.</p>
<p>
	Taking a taxicab shaves off 20 minutes, but is that worth paying $30-50? I think not.</p>
<p>
	What&#39;s not apparent from the Pace website is where, exactly, is the location of the bus stop. If you walk to the Davis St. CTA terminal, you&#39;ll find the bus stop directly in front of the station. You can pay your fare with a farecard (purchased inside the station), or on the bus itself.</p>
<p>
	It&#39;s actually very easy, in my opinion, to get to and from Evanston using public transport&mdash;I came in from Union Station via the Metra and went to O&#39;Hare via the Pace 250.</p>
