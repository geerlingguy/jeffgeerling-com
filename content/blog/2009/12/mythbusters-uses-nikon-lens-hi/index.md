	One of my favorite features of any Mythbusters shows is the high-speed sequences, where they film an explosion, a reaction, etc. on a high-speed camera, then slow it down to half or a quarter of real life speed (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BX1kvJVrjc">example</a>).</p>
<p>
	Watching season four on Netflix recently, I saw a rare closeup of the high-speed, and to my surprise, found mounted a 50mm f/1.4D Nikon lens (the same one I use on my D90 70% of the time!). It&#39;s an excellent lens, and I can understand why they use it; it&#39;s basically a &#39;light vacuum cleaner,&quot; meaning it sucks up light like few other lenses. You can only get a little wider (Nikon makes an f/1.2 (and used to make an f/0.95, and Canon used to make an f/1.0!).</p>
<p>
	When shooting high-speed, you need as much light to enter the lens as possible - you&#39;re taking sometimes 120 or more frames every second, and you have to divide the photos per second into those frames. Less photons reaching the sensor = lower picture quality. So it&#39;s understandable why they have such a nice lens on the high speed.</p>

	I&#39;m glad they&#39;re a Nikon shop :-)</p>
