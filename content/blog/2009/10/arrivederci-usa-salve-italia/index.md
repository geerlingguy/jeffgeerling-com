<p class="rteleft">On October 19, 2009, the <a href="http://www.cssr.com/english/">Redemptorist priests</a> will hold their 2009 General Chapter in Rome, Italy (<a href="http://www.zenit.org/article-26884?l=english">Zenit news story</a>), and, since they thousands of priests and missionaries spread throughout the world, they decided to stream the events of the General Chapter online (<a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/redemptorists">Ustream channel</a>). Through a series of wonderful events and conversations, I was eventually invited to help the priests with technical aspects of said streaming, and thus, I am headed over to Rome this morning.</p>
<p>I will be in Rome until October 31st, but will still be working remotely for the Archdiocese of Saint Louis. I'll also keep updating my Twitter feed, this blog, and my Flickr photostream, most likely (as time allows, of course). I won't get a ton of time to sightsee, but even a few hours would be more than enough to fall in love with Roma, I should think.</p>
<p>See you on the flipside!</p>
