<p>The Redemptorist's XXIV General Chapter is being held this year at the Salesianum, a retreat house / hotel/resort / convention center that is owned by the Saletians. The Salesianum is located about 30 minutes west of Rome's city center, and is set between some hilly farming areas and a major highway.</p>

Many beautiful Palm trees surround the Salesianum.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Also on the property is a beautiful field/hillside of olive trees; pictured below is a single olive on one of the trees. I spotted a pretty good variety of flora and fauna while walking around the property.</p>

A lone olive on a branch. Like an olive branch!</p>
<p class="rteleft">Below is one of a group of <strike>Peacocks</strike>&nbsp;peahens I noticed while walking along the southern border of the property. Apparently <strike>Peacocks</strike>&nbsp;peahens can fly (I had never seen this before), and they also make a loud squawking noise when agitated. It was an interesting sight to see!</p>

<strike>He</strike> She says &quot;Top of the mornin' to ya!&quot;</p>
<p class="rteleft">Finally, the property affords a gorgeous vista of the sunset. The two pictures below were taken about twenty minutes apart, and show the final moments of the sunset, then a little bit of Roman dusk:</p>

Beautiful sunset in Roma!</p>

Dusk in Roma - there were livestock grazing in this meadow.</p>
<p class="rteleft">All in all, the property is removed from civilization to the greatest extent possible, and is very comfortable and beautiful. I will be posting many more pictures from my excursions to the Pictures section of this site soon... hopefully tomorrow! Until then, &quot;Arrivederci!&quot;</p>
