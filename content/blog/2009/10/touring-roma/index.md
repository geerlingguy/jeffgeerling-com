Saint Mary Major Basilica.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Fortune smiled upon me today, and I was able to travel to many destinations in Rome, mostly around the Vatican. After walking past Saint Mary Major Basilica (picture above), I walked to the Trevi fountain (a nice place for a pickpocket, I would think), progressed to the Triton fountain, and then hopped on the Italian subway (the Metropolitana, or something like that).</p>

Trevi fountain. Not much room around this area.</p>

One of the subway (metro) stations in Italy - they're pretty nice.</p>
<p class="rteleft">I hopped off at the Ottaviano station, and walked down to St. Peter's Square. After taking a few touristy pictures, I walked with some St. Louis seminarians down to a wonderful little pizzeria (with some excellent 4-cheese pizza!), and then to a gelateria (for REAL italian gelato!).</p>

Mmm... real Italian gelato! I had the Crema Fiorentia and some Biscotto in a cup.</p>
<p class="rteleft">We finally visited the North American College (NAC), which afforded an extremely pleasant view of the entire city of Rome, and most especially the Vatican:</p>

<p class="rteleft">Throughout the trip, I took a few pictures of the many occurrences of 'SPQR,' standing for Senatus Populusque Romanus, &quot;The senate and the people of Rome.&quot; The inscription appears on almost all public works-related objects in the city. This image was taken in the &quot;Piazza Navona,&quot; near Bernini's &quot;Fountain of the four rivers:&quot;</p>

S.P.Q.R. - Get with the program.</p>
<p class="rteleft">To top things off, here are a couple more cool shots of the Vatican (more will be posted as time allows!):</p>
