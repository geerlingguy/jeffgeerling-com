<p>[<strong>UPDATE</strong>: For a full review of the camera, please visit the <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/review/2009-10-18/canon-powershot-g11-digital-camera-review">Canon PowerShot G11 Review</a> on MidwesternMac.com]</p>
<p>After a few weeks of phone calls, store visits, etc., I've finally found a <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=144&amp;modelid=19209">Canon PowerShot G11</a>. And none too soon, as I'm leaving for Rome in less than three days, and really wanted to get this camera as a 'pocket' camera for walking the streets of Rome!</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./canon-powershot-g11.jpg" alt="Canon PowerShot G11" width="370" height="286" >}}</p>
<p>I was almost taken in by the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=145&amp;modelid=18183">Canon PowerShot SD780IS</a> (one of the IXUS models... and the svelte black one, not the crazy colored ones) due to it's infinitesimally small size (it's about the size of a deck of cards... maybe smaller), but once I found a Best Buy with a G11 in stock (found online), I immediately called the store and ran over to pick it up. Another worthy candidate (if small size is what matters most, and you don't mind losing a lot of the physical buttons and flash hot shoe, is the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=144&amp;modelid=19210">PowerShot S90</a>. However, I'm a fan of the super-tough body/controls on the G series, and had an older S40 flake out on me a few years back.</p>
<p>The two main reasons I'm spending twice as much for the G11 are: the much larger image sensor/RAW capability, and the plethora of physical buttons. This camera feels much more like my favorite film SLR of all time, the Minolta X-700! It has ISO and EV selection dials on top, tons of switches and buttons to control everything, and has a nice flash hot shoe to boot (no pun intended)! If I like the camera while in Rome, I might just keep it on as a backup body to my D90 while shooting weddings, events, and the like. We'll have to see how it performs in high-ISO situations, to be sure.</p>
<p>I'm charging the G11's battery right now, and will start taking it through its paces this afternoon... then the rest of the month in Rome!</p>
<p>I was planning on bringing my D90 with my 20-40mm zoom lens, but I wanted something less obtrusive, and, more practically, less heavy (I walked the streets of NY, DC and Chicago over the past few months lugging the D90 + 2 lenses, and that's not a very happy proposition!).</p>
<p>A review will soon be posted on <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com">Midwestern Mac's website</a>, and I will be posting some pictures (hopefully in the 'Pictures' section on this website!) over the next weeks. More to come!</p>
