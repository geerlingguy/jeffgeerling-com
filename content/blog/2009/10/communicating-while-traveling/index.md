<p>
	In late 2009, I spent about two and a half weeks in Rome, Italy, which is far removed from my hometown of St. Louis, MO. Italy, France, Asia, etc. &ndash; all these countries are outside of AT&amp;T&#39;s nationwide coverage plans, and since I wasn&#39;t going to be traveling for many weeks, I decided to not sign up for AT&amp;T&#39;s extremely expensive worldwide plans, but rather did the following, which allowed me to stay in touch with friends and family worldwide, with different tradeoffs for each:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>SkypeOut for phone calls to friends and family.</strong><br />
		This allowed me to talk to anyone from St. Louis, Rome, etc, for a very low price of only a couple cents per minute. Downside: You must be near a WiFi hotspot or network connection. (I actually used my MacBook Pro as a hotspot for my iPhone to connect and make calls over the Internet). Phone call quality is excellent, and you can video chat and Skype for free with others using Skype.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>AT&amp;T World Traveler plan (month to month).</strong><br />
		A week before I left, I called AT&amp;T and asked them to add the $5.99/month &#39;world traveler&#39; calling plan to my account. While nothing huge, this shaves $0.30/minute off phone calls, and keeps incoming text messages free. (Normal rate is $1.29/minute, new rate is $0.99/minute). Downside: Costs a ton of money to make anything resembling a long phone call... only good for emergencies/planning Skype sessions.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>AT&amp;T Worldwide Data plan (month to month).</strong><br />
		AT&amp;T gives a few options for data while traveling abroad - I chose the $24.99/month 20 MB data plan - I get to have 20 MB of bandwidth using 3G networks in Rome. Not a horrid deal, when you consider that 1 MB = ~$5 without the plan. (Save 1/4 the money). Downside: Still costs a ton of money for data, and you need to carefully meter your bandwidth usage. Also, turn off push, visual voicemail, etc., to make sure tons of data isn&#39;t loaded in the background.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	A combination of all these tools is what worked best for me. I typically stuck with Skype (I had it running on my Mac at all times, and then on my iPhone when I wanted to make a phone call to the &#39;States), but when roaming around the city, I kept my iPhone on, and set it to &#39;data roaming OFF&#39; whenever I wasn&#39;t using the 3G/internet.</p>
