<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./IMG_1141.jpg" alt="Saint Peter's Basilica - Night" class="imagecache-article-image-large blog-image" >}}</p>
<p>Went around Rome all day today; got back an hour ago and have been processing pictures since. Still not finished, but getting close. There will be a ton of pictures of St. Peter's Basilica (interior), the Vatican Museums, the Piazza de Navona, and the Pantheon later on... hopefully tomorrow, but maybe later.</p>
