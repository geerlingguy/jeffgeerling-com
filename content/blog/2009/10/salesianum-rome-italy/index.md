<p>After a couple days in the Salesianum, a retreat house / hotel / resort-ish place located 30 minutes west of Rome, I've been able to explore most of the main areas, and have been impressed and unimpressed... 'whelmed' and 'underwhelmed,' as it were.</p>

Sign for the aula magna (grainy due to iPhone picture taking in the dark).</p>
<p>Starting with some of the best... most of the General Chapter will be held in the 'aula magna,' which is relatively state-of-the-art. The auditorium has seating for 250 (something around that number), and has a pretty complex but functional A/V system. I will soon be writing up a post about how we're taking the video from the auditorium and putting it online for general consumption... that will probably be posted to OpenSourceCatholic.com.</p>

The inside of the aula magna - pretty nicely arrayed, imo.</p>
<p>Other than the auditorium and the main dining area, the layout of the place is confusing as heck, and (in my estimation) built in the 60s or 70s; the architecture screams of a modernist influence, considering the plethora of right angles and roofs, level variations, and right-angled hallways.</p>

One of the many rooms/hallways. Always looks the same. Confusing as heck.</p>
<p class="rteleft">I haven't yet had a chance to tour the outside, though I know there are some scenic areas, and more than a few beautiful (and very large) palm trees. There's also a walkway that leads into a pine forest, which I'm eager to check into.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Tomorrow I'll be touring the city of Rome for a bit, and meeting up with some seminarians I know from the North American College (NAC). Then it's back to the Salesianum!</p>
