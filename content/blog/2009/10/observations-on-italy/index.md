<p>My observations about Italy / Rome, so far:</p>
<ul>
    <li>&quot;Everything is in its place, but nothing is in order&quot; &lt;-- so true.</li>
    <li>Hot Chocolate is <em>very</em> thick here - it's like molasses!</li>
    <li>Unlike St. Louis, a rainy morning on Monday does not mean a cloudy, muggy week</li>
    <li>Italians talk very fast - <em>multo veloce</em></li>
    <li>Italians have one rule when parking: park wherever there is space.</li>
    <li>You can easily spot a tourist. Just look for someone with a map. (Without one, good luck navigating the narrow, crooked, and poorly-marked streets of Rome!).</li>
    <li>If you're American, remember to order water <em>senza gas</em>.</li>
    <li>I haven't had an Espresso, but I hear they're quite the kick. Should I try one?</li>
    <li>Italy vs. Europe - it's actually quite true:</li>
</ul>
