In Apple's 10.12.1 macOS update, the file 'ApplePaySplashSA.tiff' seems to [spilled the beans](http://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/25/images-of-new-macbook-pro-leaked/) on Apple's new MacBook Pro's (and possibly other laptops') contextual function row key replacement. I'm guessing this change won't make it's way to Apple's [Magic Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Keyboard-MLA22LL-A/dp/B016QO64FI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1477429768&sr=1-3&keywords=magic+keyboard&linkCode=ll1&tag=mmjjg-20&linkId=6ec4405ce408fd1466c19201c218e8a7) for some time... but for users of Apple's laptops, having a 'software-defined' escape key might be a pill that's hard to swallow.

But fret not! Apple also included a nice little addition to it's Keyboard configuration options in 10.12.1—you can now [remap the Escape key](//www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2016/remapping-caps-lock-key-escape-macos-sierra) to any of the other modifier keys on your keyboard (see screenshot below). So you can join the rest of us crazy vim users and [make the worthless Caps Lock key actually be useful](https://simplyian.com/2015/01/08/The-real-reason-why-Caps-Lock-and-Escape-are-in-terrible-positions/).

Unless you like [SHOUTING ALL DAY](http://netiquette.wikia.com/wiki/Rule_number_2_-_Do_not_use_all_caps), there's no reason to even have a caps lock key. Join the hipsters and switch it to Escape! Besides allowing you to have a hardware Escape key on Apple's latest laptops, it's a larger and easier to use button than that tiny half-chicklet at the top left of ye olde keyboards.
