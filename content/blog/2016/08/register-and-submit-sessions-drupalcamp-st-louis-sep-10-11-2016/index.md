The time is here! The rest of the [DrupalCamp St. Louis 2016](https://2016.drupalstl.org/) organizers and I were working feverishly this week to get all our ducks in a row, and we now have online registration opened up for DrupalCamp St. Louis 2016! Here are the relevant details:

  - **Dates**: September 10 & 11, 2016
  - **Location**: University of Missouri, St. Louis
  - **Keynote**: [Larry Garfield, "Software Management Lessons from the 1960s"](https://2016.drupalstl.org/sessions/keynote)
  - **Price**: $35, or $15 for students ([Register on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/drupalcamp-st-louis-2016-tickets-26132917259))

You'll get a snazzy T-Shirt, a catered lunch, and the fuzzy warm feeling of being part of the great Drupal open source community! Plus _I'll_ be there!

You can still [submit session proposals](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflw4ibIkc5mJaO8479G4firVDAvVg6ATYY7ZpEkjak2uyb5A/viewform?c=0&w=1) until August 17—so get your proposal in soon; we'll announce the full set of selected sessions on August 20th!
