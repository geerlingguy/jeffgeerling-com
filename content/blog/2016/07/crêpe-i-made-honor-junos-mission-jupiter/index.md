I forgot to post here, after posting to different social networks—when NASA's [Juno](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/) orbiter was placed in Jupiter's orbit, it just so happened to coincide with my family's Sunday night crêpe tradition (see [how to make gluten/dairy/egg-free crepes](/blog/2016/gluten-egg-and-dairy-free-sweet-crêpe-recipe), or [how to make normal crepes](/articles/miscellaneous/how-make-a-cr%C3%AApe)).

So what did I do? I used some peanut butter, cream cheese, and nutella to try to depict a tasty food version of Jupiter:
