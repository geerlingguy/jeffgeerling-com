My wife and I needed an extra dresser to keep up with the growing family (third baby is on the way in a few months!), and since we would rather buy things that last—but not buy new if we can save a bundle of money—we bought a used wood dresser on Craigslist:

<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./new-wood-dresser.jpg" alt="Craigslist wood dresser" width="300" height="396" class="insert-image" >}}</p>

First lesson: always inspect every last bit of furniture before loading it up and hauling it away! Most of the rails were in not-great condition, and the guides on the drawers weren't in great shape either:

<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./new-dresser-broken-wood-rail.jpg" alt="Craigslist dresser with old broken wood drawer rail guide" width="500" height="375" class="insert-image" >}}</p>

We decided to make the best of the situation and make as good a repair as possible, resulting in much improved (like new!) rails:

<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./new-dresser-replaced-wood-rail.jpg" alt="Craigslist dresser with new and fixed wood drawer rail guide next to old worn drawer rail guide" width="500" height="375" class="insert-image" >}}</p>

The process was basically:

  1. Measure the old boards, get some Poplar boards that were as close to the old dimension as possible.
  2. Trim the width of the new boards with a circular saw (since I don't have a table saw).
  3. Route the channels in the middle of the sides with a router (thanks, Dad, for letting me use your router/table!).
  4. Screw the new rails in place, then cover them in what I'm calling 'wood snot'—it's [Slideeze Lubricant](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006ZP8JC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=mmjjg-20&linkId=c27b2ff9ec3b2a66ab03da84d7b4d6e7) meant for wood.
