I've been subscribed to the [Modules Unraveled podcast](https://modulesunraveled.com/podcast) since somewhere around episode 40, and it's one of my favorite Drupal-oriented podcasts. I was thrilled to get an email from Brian Lewis last week asking if I'd talk about [Honeypot](https://www.drupal.org/project/honeypot) (a popular Drupal module I maintain) on the podcast.

We discussed the module itself, ways to combat spam in general, some reasons why you would or would _not_ want to use Honeypot for your particular site, and also the experience of porting the module to Drupal 8—a [three year undertaking](http://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/honeypot-drupal-8-3-years).

The full/raw interview is available on YouTube:

And the edited audio from the podcast is available on the episode page on Modules Unraveled: [Protecting Drupal 8 Sites From Spam Using Honeypot with Jeff Geerling](https://modulesunraveled.com/podcast/153-protecting-drupal-8-sites-spam-using-honeypot-jeff-geerling-modules-unraveled-podcast).
