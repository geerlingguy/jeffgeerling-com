This is yet another 'hello, world' post on yet another personal blog. I've used static site generators, hosted services, Drupal, Wordpress, and a plethora of other platforms for blogs through the years, but I'm finally looking forward to consolidating <em>everything</em>—from every blog I've consistently written—in this one central blog. Hopefully I'll be able to do so while preserving URLs and images, as most of the data I have is at least structured and able to be migrated from other Drupal sites.

Stay tuned for more!
