I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be delivering two sessions at [php[tek]](https://tek.phparch.com/) this year:

  - [Highly-available Drupal on a Raspberry Pi Cluster](https://tek.phparch.com/speakers/#70505)
  - [ProTips for Staying Sane while Working from Home](https://tek.phparch.com/speakers/#70505)

Both topics are near and dear to me, as I've had more time to refine the Ansible roles and performance of Drupal 8 on a Raspberry Pi (see [Drupal Pi](https://github.com/geerlingguy/drupal-pi) and the [Raspberry Pi Dramble](http://www.pidramble.com/) website for more info), and I've also been spending some time lately optimizing my WFH environment (the nice cave-like office in my basement, where I spend the majority of my waking hours!).

Another interesting tidbit: after years of holding php[tek] in Chicago, this year php[architect] decided to move the conference to St. Louis, MO, where I live! It's a lot easier to pay the travel costs when the conference is about a 20 minute drive away. Read more about the conference on the [php[tek] About page](https://tek.phparch.com/about/).

This year could be an interesting one, in terms of conferences—I may be able to talk at php[tek], a North American AnsibleFest, and maybe even DrupalCon New Orleans or MidCamp! We'll see...
