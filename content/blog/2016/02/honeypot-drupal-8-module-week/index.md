For the past few months, Acquia's Dev Center blog has been running a series of posts about modules that have been fully ported to Drupal 8, and I'm happy to announce that this week's module of the week is Honeypot! See post by Jam: [Drupal 8 Module of the Week: Honeypot](https://dev.acquia.com/blog/drupal-8-module-of-the-week/drupal-8-module-of-the-week-honeypot/25/02/2016/9766).

There are a good number of posts already in this series, and more to come, so check out the [Drupal Modules](https://dev.acquia.com/learn?type_1=blog&field_topic_tid%5B%5D=2221) topic on the Dev Center blog for more!
