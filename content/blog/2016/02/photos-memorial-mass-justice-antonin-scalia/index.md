Yesterday I was invited by a friend to photograph the Memorial Mass for Justice Antonin Scalia at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis. Justice Scalia was a Catholic first and Supreme Court Justice second... may we all live our lives in a way where our faith, family, and morals lead our work and interaction (and not vice-versa)!

I've uploaded all the photos to Flickr: [Memorial Mass for Justice Antonin Scalia](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/albums/72157665047654382), and here are a couple of my favorites below (it's hard _not_ to have some majestic images when shooting at the Cathedral!):
