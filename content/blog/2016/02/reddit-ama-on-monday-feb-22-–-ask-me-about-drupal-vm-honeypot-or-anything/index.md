I'll be hosting a Reddit AMA on the [Drupal subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/drupal/) tomorrow morning, Monday February 22, starting at 10 a.m. Eastern / 9 a.m. Central.

During the AMA, I would love to hear any questions you have about Drupal VM, Honeypot, Ansible, writing, open source communities, or really anything else you can think of! I just wrapped up a big project last week, so I'll have a couple hours tomorrow to talk about anything and everything with the Drupal community on Reddit. Even horse-sized ducks and Legos, if you're so inclined.

I'll also be formally announcing the next major release of Drupal VM, with some amazing new features for local Drupal development, so please check in tomorrow morning!
