I started [Server Check.in](https://servercheck.in/), a simple website and server uptime monitoring service, almost four years ago. I built it when I was in the hospital and recovering from mono (symptoms were worse because of one of the Crohn's-related drugs I was taking), and it's been a very slowly-but-steadily growing service since.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://servercheck.in/">{{< figure src="./server-checkin-logo-300.jpg" alt="Server Check.in logo" width="300" height="300" class="blog-image" >}}</a></p>

I wrote a four-year retrospective post on the service, and published it on the Server Check.in blog: [Four years running Server Check.in](https://servercheck.in/blog/four-years-running-server-checkin).

It's one of the many side projects I run under the umbrella of [Midwestern Mac, LLC](http://www.midwesternmac.com/), and it's nice to be able to look back and see all the progress I've made, where the work has taken me (e.g. publishing a book on Ansible!)... and to realize that I was finally able to finish that retrospective post because of some free time afforded by _another_ Crohn's-related hospitalization—this time due to surgery.

So Crohn's is good for progress in building and expanding Server Check.in, at least :)
