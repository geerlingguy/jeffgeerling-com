A few months ago, [when I spoke at php[tek]](http://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2016/highly-available-drupal-on-raspberry-pi-cluster-phptek-2016-session) in St. Louis, I had the honor of being interviewed by Cal Evans on the [Voices of the elePHPant podcast](https://voicesoftheelephpant.com/)! In the interview, we discussed Drupal 8, Acquia, the [Raspberry Pi Dramble](http://www.pidramble.com/), and the PHP community.

Check out the interview: [Interview with Jeff Geerling - Voices of the elePHPant](https://voicesoftheelephpant.com/2016/09/27/interview-jeff-gerrling/).

There's also a video recording of the podcast, embedded below:
