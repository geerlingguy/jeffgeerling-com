I decided to discount [Ansible for DevOps on LeanPub to $0.99](https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops) for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The book has already been purchased by over 8,000 people on Amazon, LeanPub, and the iBooks Store, and is the only book available that covers the latest version of Ansible—and is continuously updated!

I've written a lot about the [process of self-publishing](http://www.jeffgeerling.com/tags/self-publishing), in case you're interested. I'm hoping to keep updating Ansible for DevOps every quarter or so indefinitely, to make it the best resource now—and as long as possible—for learning infrastructure automation!
