I'm excited to announce that I'll be speaking at [AnsibleFest San Francisco 2016](https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest), on July 28th, giving a session titled **Ansible Roles - for Fun and Profit!**

AnsibleFest is the major bi-annual Ansible conference, full of case studies, sessions and announcements. I'm excited to finally be able to attend, as I've been an avid user of Ansible since 2013, even to the point of writing one of the most popular introductory books on Ansible, [Ansible for DevOps](http://www.ansiblefordevops.com/).

I use Ansible roles extensively for private infrastructure projects, as well as open source projects like [Drupal VM](http://www.drupalvm.com/), and I maintain most of the top 50 most downloaded Ansible roles on the community role repository, [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/explore#/)—so I've spent quite a bit of time making sure my roles follow best practices, are well-tested, thoroughly-documented, and maintainable... all while being cross-platform (most support Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, and RHEL at a minimum)!

I'm going to try to share as much of my successful role architecture and maintenance strategies, as well as lessons learned from maintaining a moderately successful Vagrant project built on top of dozens of open source Ansible roles.

I hope you'll attend AnsibleFest if you have any interest in DevOps, infrastructure management, or sysadmin best practices—and if you can't make it, I'm sure Ansible will share slides and other sessions soon after the 'Fest!

Finally, I'll try to have a few copies of _Ansible for DevOps_ on hand to sell, and if you want, I'll scribble some indecipherable text on the inside cover for you!
