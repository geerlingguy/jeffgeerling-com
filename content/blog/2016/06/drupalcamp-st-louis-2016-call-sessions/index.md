**[DrupalCamp St. Louis 2016](https://2016.drupalstl.org/) will be held on September 10-11 in St. Louis, MO**, on the campus of the University of Missouri, St. Louis, and we're excited to announce that [session submissions are open](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1oF0bQ0jAvW3WnZ5PLvu2ypsxlJnUJpUTO6BWgCCZrPo/viewform)!

We'd love to hear people speak about Drupal business, case studies, coding, community, DevOps, front end, PHP, project management, security, or any other Drupal topic. If you're interested in speaking, please [submit a session](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1oF0bQ0jAvW3WnZ5PLvu2ypsxlJnUJpUTO6BWgCCZrPo/viewform) for consideration, and we'll announce the selected sessions before August 1st.

Need some ideas for inspiration, or some guidelines for what makes a great DrupalCamp session? Please read through the [Session FAQs](http://2016.midcamp.org/session-faq) created by the amazing organizers of MidCamp—the same general things apply to DrupalCamp St. Louis.

Haven't spoken at a DrupalCamp before? Now's your chance to shine!

We're also accepting camp sponsorships. Please see our [Camp Sponsors](https://2016.drupalstl.org/sponsors) page for information on how you can help support one of the midwest's best Drupal events!
