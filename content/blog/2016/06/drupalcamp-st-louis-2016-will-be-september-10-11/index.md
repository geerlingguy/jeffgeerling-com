I wanted to post this as a 'save the date' to any other midwestern Drupalists—here in St. Louis, we'll be hosting our [third annual DrupalCamp](https://2016.drupalstl.org/) on September 10 and 11 (Saturday and Sunday) in St. Louis, MO. We'll have sessions on Saturday, and a community/sprint day Sunday, and just like last year, we'll record all the sessions and post them to the [Drupal STL YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9idqW3o-ZvmlB5MLGzw2_Q) after the Camp.

We're still working on a few details (nailing down the location, getting things set up so we can accept session submissions and registrations, etc.), but if you're interested in coming, please head over to the [official DrupalCamp STL 2016](https://2016.drupalstl.org/) website and sign up to be notified of further information!

We're also seeking sponsors this year—read through the [sponsors page](https://2016.drupalstl.org/sponsors) for sponsorship levels and benefits, and help make this another great community event!
