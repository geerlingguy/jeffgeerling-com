After a few months of testing, I'm happy to announce [Hosted Apache Solr](https://hostedapachesolr.com/) now supports Search API Solr with Drupal 8! Both [Search API](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api) and [Search API Solr](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr) have been getting closer to stable releases, and more people have been requesting Drupal 8 search cores, so I decided to finish testing and updating support guides this weekend.

Note that getting Solr and search pages configured in Drupal 8 is a bit different than in Drupal 7 (even if you were using the Search API module instead of the older Apache Solr Search module)—I posted a detailed setup guide earlier this year: [Set up a faceted Apache Solr search page on Drupal 8 with Search API Solr and Facets](//www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2016/set-faceted-apache-solr-search-page-on-drupal-8-search-api-solr-and-facets).

I still haven't migrated either this site or Hosted Apache Solr to Drupal 8 yet, so I don't have a canonical Drupal 8 reference site using Hosted Apache Solr at this time, but I've been working on a few other Drupal 8 sites, and am happy to report I can't imagine building a site in Drupal 7 again, if I can help it :) There are a few rough edges, but [all the great new features](http://www.slideshare.net/geerlingguy/drupal-8-a-brief-introduction) more than make up for that!
