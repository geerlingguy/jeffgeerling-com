How do you know you've been thinking about work too much? When your wife relates a conversation she had with you in the morning, and you don't remember a word, but can definitely see how what you said relates to what you're working on:

<blockquote>Saith my wife: "Jeff, how do you set your alarm?"

My (groggy) reply: "Hit field, the arrow, then default."</blockquote>

Now, this could possibly have something to do with alarm clocks. There are often arrows on them, and you hit buttons... but I know better. I was referring to:


```
$this->addFieldMapping('field', 'source')->defaultValue(0);
```

...which I have probably typed about 100 times in the past week, and maybe 20 or so last night during a late-night debugging session with the Migration process of <a href="http://www.flocknote.com/">flockNote</a> v2 to v3 (from a proprietary WAMP-based system to a new <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0">Drupal 7</a> LAMP-based system).

It's sad, I know, but I hope you'll like what myself, Matt, Barrett, and the rest of the flockNote team have come up with over the past few months. It's been a marathon, but expect some great news about flockNote very soon!
