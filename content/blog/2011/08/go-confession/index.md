Seriously—if you're a Catholic, do it! I don't care when you last went—a day, a week, a year ago? It's always the right time to revisit this excellent, and under-utilized Sacrament.

Some good reading from my friend James, over at <em>The Forum</em>: <a href="http://catholicpublius.blogspot.com/2011/08/culture-of-confession.html">Rebuilding a Culture of Confession</a>.
