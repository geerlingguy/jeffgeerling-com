Thanks to iOS5's support for contentEditable text areas, rich text editors like TinyMCE and CKEditor (two of my favorites, which I install on many Drupal sites using the WYSIWYG module) now work great for editing content on the web in mobile Safari!

This means that I'll be more likely to do site content work on the road with my iPad 2. I just wish they supported file select fields so I could also add images more easily on the go.

Check out all the details over on Midwestern Mac: <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/wysiwyg-editing">WYSIWYG Editing (contentEditable support) in iOS 5</a>.
