[<strong>Update:</strong> I received a demo unit and put it through its paces: <a href="/review/audio-and-video/fostex-ar-4i-iphone-4-stereo-a">read my review of the Fostex AR-4i here</a>. (Works with both iPhone 4 and 4S).]

Just found out about this new product through the YouTube grapevine:
<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./fostex-ar-4i.jpg" alt="Fostex AR-4i" width="342" height="400" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
The <a href="http://www.fostexinternational.com/docs/latest_news/EFpkpyAuukEeGfbdUf.shtml">Fostex AR-4i</a> is said to allow for multiple microphone input, and works with the iPhone 4's dock connector. It looks like a rather klunky device, meant more for handheld use than any existing tripod mount (unless the device has a tripod mount on it, which would be handy).

It also looks like there's a built-in level meter and headphone jack (hopefully with selectable input/output levels...). It comes with two rather robot-like mic arms, which might be nice for recording concerts. I'm presuming one would need to use a Fostex-provided app to record in stereo (I don't think Voice Memos of FiRe, for example, allow two-channel recording).

It's good to see a new iPhone audio interface on the market, since <a href="/blog/2010/new-blue-mikey-will-not-work-w">Blue seems to have dropped the ball</a> on iPhone 4 support.

I hope to get my hands on one of these guys to test it and add its information to my comprehensive <a href="/articles/photography/iphone-4-ipad-external-mic-audio-input">iPhone 4/iPad 2/iPod Touch external microphone guide</a>.
