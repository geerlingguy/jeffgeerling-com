In case you've been living under a rock for a while, here's the best explanation to date as to why the Church will be implementing a new translation of the Roman Missal (basically, the words spoken by the Priest and/or the laity during the Holy Mass):

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/25418957?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0"></iframe><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/25418957">Word for Word [Teens]</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/lifeteen">Life Teen</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></div>

So far I've seen very little that really hits hard from official lines of communication from the Church (a lot of info for liturgists, priests, and Catholic addicts, but not so much for the Catholic everyman). Maybe some Catholic parishes could distribute this video to their parishioners?

<em>A tip 'o the hat to my little Sister, who reminded me of this video, and got me to finally watch it!</em>
