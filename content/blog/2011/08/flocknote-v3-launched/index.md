Lest I forget to mention it, <a href="http://www.flocknote.com/">flockNote's 'version 3' website</a> has been launched as of Wednesday afternoon! I spent many (if not most) of my waking hours working on the website and hundreds of features contained within, and after a couple days up and running, the website's still going like a champ!

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flocknote.com/">{{< figure src="./flocknote-front.jpg" alt="flockNote v3 Home Page" width="425" height="394" class="blog-image" >}}
</a>Excellent home page design by Matthew Warner.</p>
The site is built entirely on top of <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0">Drupal 7</a>, and over the past three months, I've grown to appreciate Drupal many times more, as I've learned so much more about the deep and thorough APIs—bugs and all—that have developed into an extremely solid, reliable, and capable framework that is Drupal 7.x. Heck, <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2011/dreaming-drupal">I even <em>dream</em> about Drupal</a> these days!

Expect more writing about the new features and platform that is flockNote v3 in the coming days—the ride's not over yet, though my 10+ hour workdays are, for a time!
