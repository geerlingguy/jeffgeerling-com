<p>I finally had time to read through a brief <a href="http://cnsblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/18/in-kenya-web-savvy-seminarians-with-no-internet/">article on St. Thomas Aquinas (great patron!) major seminary</a> in Nairobi, Kenya&mdash;a seminary with computers disconnected from the Internet, mostly because the $8,000 USD fee to wire the building is outside the limits of the seminary&#39;s budget.</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing the post&#39;s author decided to focus on the Internet (or lack thereof) in order to draw readers&#39; attention (I guess it worked, since I&#39;m mentioning the article...), but the best part of the article was in the last paragraph.</p>
<p>Msgr. Francis Blood (director of the <a href="http://archstl.org/missions/">Mission Office</a> here in the Archdiocese of St. Louis) asked Cardinal John Njue about what his priorities should be for sending missionary support to Nairobi. Cardinal Njue responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Projects that focus on deepening of the faith&rdquo; take priority</strong>, said the cardinal. In addition, he said, &ldquo;the issue of the formation of the priests is so vital,&rdquo; because &ldquo;if the priests are shaky&rdquo; when facing the challenges to the church, it will &ldquo;trickle down.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s good to see that, in areas of the world where the faith is taking root and expanding rapidly, we have such focused prelates!</p>
<p>The U.S., I think, is on the right track at this point in time, but I know that there were many problems in our priorities and seminary system in the past 40 years. Having great, faithful, and loving loving priests is essential to having a strong and vibrant faith, and great Eucharistic devotion. I know this is an area most Western countries have struggled with for a while, and I pray for things to get better every day!</p>
