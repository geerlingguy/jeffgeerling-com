<p>In the recent hubbub over Motorola Xoom pricing, I started to think a bit more about the current landscape of tablets on the market today&mdash;the iPad, and the competition.</p>
<p>Obviously, the iPad has won round 1. And it looks like round 2 is starting with Apple throwing all the punches&mdash;even though there&#39;s been no word on a second revision from the horse&#39;s mouth (yet).</p>
<p>But I was thinking to myself, &quot;Why (and how?!) is Apple the only company selling a worthy $499 tablet.&quot; Apple&#39;s always been known to most people in the world as a luxury brand&mdash;and they are, in some senses&mdash;but why is Motorola introducing a tablet that retails for $799 minimum at launch, and will someday have a $599 version?</p>
<p>Motorola, and others in the &#39;actually working / almost shipping&#39; tablet manufacturing market, probably see that the mid-range iPads are more popular than the cheap ones, and they target this price range/feature set. So, in a sense, what they&#39;re doing makes sense: target the large part of the bell curve of tablet sales, and make a great sub-$800 tablet.</p>
<p>However, I think they neglect to see one of Apple&#39;s greatest advantages: <strong>the upsell</strong>.</p>
<p>Apple has a $499 iPad, sure. But I don&#39;t know anyone that owns it. People instead go to the store feeling like they can afford $499 (it&#39;s only $500, right?). Then they look at numbers like 16 GB with WiFi only, and then see that they can just pay a <em>little</em> more and get 32 GB. A <em>little</em> more than that, and they can also have 3G, in case they ever need it.</p>
<p>Thus, Apple can still make a small margin on the $499 iPad, but they absorb the downside of that small margin by selling people the second model in the lineup. <strong>The $499 iPad is worth <em>far</em> more than you can imagine to Apple&#39;s iPad sales&mdash;even if it&#39;s not the hottest selling model.</strong> Even if Motorola would take a loss selling a $499 Xoom, they should do it.</p>
