<h4>Sean Patrick Lovett</h4>

This presentation was given at the <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/">2011 Catholic New Media Conference</a>. Below are my notes on the presentation:

<h4>Marconi &amp; Vatican Radio</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Nobel prize winner contacted by the Pope (Pius XI) to help with Vatican communications.</li>
	<li>He was the inventor/innovator (Steve J.) of the early 1900s.</li>
	<li>He helped Pius XI set up Vatican Radio (more than 80 years old).

<ul>
	<li>VR broadcasts in 40 different languages.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>VR continues because:

<ul>
	<li>Courage and flexibility, no matter what!</li>
	<li>Only radio station in the world that was denouncing the Nazi regime.</li>
	<li>Shortwave, to medium wave, to satellite radio, to podcast, etc.</li>
	<li>Collaborates with Vatican Television (youtube.com/vatican). Live information, news.va integration, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Iconic Images</h4>

<ul>
	<li>BXVI using iPad to send the first Papal Tweet.</li>
	<li>JPII sending the first Apostolic Letter via a laptop.</li>
	<li>"If the Pope can do it, so can we."<!--break--></li>
</ul>

<h4>Progress and Adaptation</h4>

<ul>
	<li>1995: Vatican went online with three servers (Archangels).</li>
	<li>JPII was the most media-friendly Pope in history; question is still out how much he used media and how much media used him...

<ul>
	<li>Last letter: "Rapid Development" - hails the new advances in Internet.</li>
	<li>Church beginning to realize there's a brave new world (Digital Continent) being built within this world.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>"Is it good, and is it useful."

<ul>
	<li>These are the two questions the Vatican asks when considering new forms of communication.</li>
	<li>(These are the questions Rev. Lombardi asked about the iPod)</li>
	<li>Does it further the Kingdom of God? Does it improve the human race?</li>
	<li>Paul VI: "What use is it having a magnificent instrument if you don't use it or put it to <em>magnificent</em>use?"

<ul>
	<li>It is up to us to use these instruments magnificently.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
	<li>Vatican Bloggers Conference (2011) - good to meet...</li>
	<li>Document on technology use in seminaries is still under progress.</li>
	<li>Vatican <em>is</em>trying.

<ul>
	<li>Vatican is a pyramid (one to many, monologue, slow) / Internet is a sphere (many to many, fast)</li>
	<li>How can the Vatican compete with 'the social network'?</li>
	<li>Vatican.va, News.va, Pope2You doesn't do what new media does: The Pope isn't going to respond...

<ul>
	<li>It's not that we don't care, it's that we don't <em>dare</em>.</li>
	<li>There are no 'like' options.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>The Vatican has the identity of an organization that is <em>part</em> of a network, but it is not <em>the</em>Network.

<ul>
	<li>Vatican will always choose quality over quantity, technique over technology, understanding over knowledge.</li>
	<li>"Never before have we known so much and understood so little."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
	<li>The Pope

<ul>
	<li>One of the few leaders in the world today who has so much worth listening to.</li>
	<li>The Vatican tries to make sure that everything the Pope says can quickly reach the most people in the fastest way possible.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>Vatican Player
