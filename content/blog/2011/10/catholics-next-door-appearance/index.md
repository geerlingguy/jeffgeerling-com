I didn't have much time today to post this earlier (I was driving home from a trip which took me through five states in six days, and had to do this on the road), but this afternoon I was on the excellent '<a href="http://gregandjennifer.com/">Catholics Next Door</a>' radio show on the <a href="http://www.siriusxm.com/thecatholicchannel">Sirius XM Catholic Channel</a>.

I was happy to <a href="http://gregandjennifer.com/?p=5380">speak with Greg and Jennifer Willits</a> about <a href="http://flocknote.com/">flockNote</a>, about parish communications, and about helping Catholic organizations get connected to their flock in various ways.

Then I continued driving home from Chicago :)

I don't know if they have an online archive of their shows, but if I can find a link to the audio at some point, I'll try to provide it. I'm also not too familiar with satellite radio, since I've never subscribed (Pandora + free radio has worked for my musical tastes), so I don't know if there are any rebroadcasts or ways of listening to past shows...
