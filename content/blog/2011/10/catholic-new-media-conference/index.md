I gave two presentations at the CNMC:

<ul>
	<li><a href="/articles/religion/2011/gadgets-gizmos-sanctifying-mob">Sanctifying Mobile Technology</a>&nbsp;(...and a little <a href="/blog/2011/sanctifying-mobile-technology">blog post</a> about it)</li>
	<li><a href="/religion/2011/continuity-eternal-word-new-me">The Continuity of the Eternal Word in New Media</a></li>
</ul>

Live streams were available on the <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/">CNMC website</a> via Ustream, and photos can be found in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/cnmc11/pool/">CNMC11 group on Flickr</a>.
