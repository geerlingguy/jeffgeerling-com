Over the past couple days, I've been moving all my websites from a few different servers to a newly-configured VPS hosted at Hot Drupal. Up until now, I've operated most of my sites on shared hosting, and that's been working great for me, but my sites' traffic has prompted this upgrade.

A few of the sites may go a bit cattywompus over the next day or two as I change DNS settings and configurations.

On a related note, I'm going to slowly move a little bit of content (especially videos) to outside services like YouTube and Vimeo so I can focus more on my articles, reviews, and this blog on this website. I just don't have time to maintain the photo area, video podcasts, etc.
