<h4>The Bad, the Good, and Hope - by Matt Warner</h4>

This presentation was given at the <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/">2011 Catholic New Media Conference</a>. Below are my notes on the presentation:

<h4>The Bad News</h4>

<ul>
	<li>The Catholic Church is out of control ... of our message.</li>
	<li>Being overly cautious about our message has been detrimental to our image.</li>
	<li>Catholics aren't really using Catholic new media; they're not really using old media either...

<ul>
	<li>2% of Catholics follow religious/spiritual material on Facebook.</li>
	<li>11% listen to Catholic radio.</li>
	<li>Reason? Catholics aren't 'not interested in Catholic media' – Catholics aren't interested in their Catholic faith.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>Technology is not going to bring people back to the Church. YOU are. People are. Needs meaningful relationships.</li>
	<li>Online Search (we stink)

<ul>
	<li>Examples: Jesus (nothing Catholic on the first page), God (nothing Catholic on the first page), "Who is God?"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>The Good News</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Good examples: Catholic Channel, CatholicTV, CTT, CatholiCon, DivineOffice.org, blogs, etc.</li>
	<li>Pope Benedict gets it.</li>
	<li>We are slowly rekindling a missionary spirit.<!--break--></li>
	<li>There is less blaming others and more doing our part.</li>
	<li>Recruiting talent and leaders.</li>
	<li>Entrepreneurial Evangelization: Where is the Catholic Silicon Valley? Who will incubate great Catholic ideas?</li>
	<li>Idea: Turn the parish's annual financial report into a statement of mission, success.

<ul>
	<li>"Donors don't want to support a spreadsheet. They want to support movements. We need to tell our stories."</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>We live in exciting times!</li>
</ul>
