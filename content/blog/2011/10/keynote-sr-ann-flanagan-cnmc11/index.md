<h4>Sr. Anne Flanagan</h4>

This presentation was given at the <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/">2011 Catholic New Media Conference</a>. Below are my notes on the presentation:

"Go teach the gospel. We have all been commissioned. What is the next step?" (Sister's introductory haiku).

<h4>Blessed James Alberione</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Has so much to teach us about being evangelizers in a culture of media.</li>
	<li>He was constantly connecting media ministry with vows in the orders he founded.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Looking at media apostolate in the light of the Angelus</h4>

<h5>"And she conceived by the Holy Spirit"</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Everything comes from God.</li>
	<li>Networks of collaborators (the Pauline family). "The mystical body of St. Paul."</li>
	<li>Always begin from Bethlehem. (Humble roots).</li>
	<li>We need to use our imaginations, our hearts and our minds.<!--break--></li>
</ul>

<h5>"Be it done to me according to your Word"</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Chastity ≠ Sterility, but spiritual fruitfulness. It is an engine of creativity.</li>
	<li>We should be forming a new mentality in society; we must be receptive (let it be done to me).</li>
	<li>From the tabernacle, Jesus instructs; "I am your light and I will use you to enlighten..."

<ul>
	<li>Let everyone be a beacon, an evangelist, a secretary of St. Paul.</li>
	<li>Your life should be transformed by the message.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>"Saints are needed for these yet untrodden paths." This is a <em>universal</em>call to holiness.

<ul>
	<li>The laity must complete/supply what is lacking in the heirarchical apostolate. This is our baptismal priesthood.</li>
	<li>The Church needs life apologists today—not necessarily people who can explain theological realities.</li>
	<li>How does Church teaching intersect with life? In marriages and family life?</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>Your faith is something grand and glorious, that you should parade down the road!

<ul>
	<li>Don't hide behind too many words of the Catechism and teaching.</li>
	<li>We need the ability to detect needs and respond.</li>
	<li>Where shall we get our strength? From the Eucharist: "Light, comfort, nourishment, victory over evil."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>"And dwelt among us"</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Obedience: makes receptivity to the Word manifest. Not a passive obedience.</li>
	<li>If you remain in step with the Church, you will continue to be dynamic, successful, and effective. Not just starting with the Church; staying with the Church.</li>
	<li>Don't speak only of religion, but speak of <strong>everything</strong>in a Christian manner.

<ul>
	<li>Penetrate all thought and learning with the Gospel.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>Every communications development has sparked a 'New Evangelization'

<ul>
	<li>That's what's happening among us today: A new culture is rising up—a young, global culture. It has the effects of human sin, and the seeds of the Gospel.</li>
	<li>These are new means of divine providence.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>bit.ly/autobiog - Alberione's writings.</li>
</ul>
