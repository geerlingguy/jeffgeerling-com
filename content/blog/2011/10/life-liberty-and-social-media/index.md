Found: An interesting article from Gladden J. Pappin on <a href="http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=1796">Liberty, Technology, and the Advent of Social Networking</a>. It's a bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn't_read">tl;dr</a>, but I've read through once, and hope to sit with it a little longer sometime.

The article (and many like it) makes me think a bit about the theme of personhood on the Internet, and how our use and overuse of social media, blogging, etc. in building our own self-image is something about which we must always be cautious.

I recently watched the Star Trek TNG Episodes '<a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Booby_Trap_(episode)">Booby Trap</a>' and '<a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Galaxy%27s_Child_(episode)">Galaxy's Child</a>', and while I'm no supporter of the strange philosophies that guide Star Trek morality/ethics, I wonder if we are becoming like Geordi LaForge, who fell in love with a projected image of a person on the holodeck.

One of the keys to using social media effectively is to keep a proper separation between one's true self-image and the image one projects on the 'holodeck' of the Internet (and make sure you know that others are not defined by tweets and avatars).
