I took this photo from the ground at Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) in Chicago, IL over the weekend. I also took a bunch of HD videos from the <a href="http://www.theskydeck.com/">SkyDeck</a> that I'll be putting together into a few minutes of video. Truly a majestic building, and I wonder if we'll ever see something taller in the U.S. Seems our architectural prowess is taking a back seat to the rest of the world lately.

As an aside, if the iPhone 4 takes pictures of this quality, I can't wait to get an iPhone 4S and ditch my Nikon D7000 for many of my trips. While using a 50mm f/1.4 inside in a dim room and still getting nice shots is awesome, having a camera that's always with me and gets 'pretty good' shots is also awesome. I hope to get a 4S soon!
