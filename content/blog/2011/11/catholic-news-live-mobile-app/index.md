Just wanted to announce here the immediate availability of the Android version of the <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/about/mobile-app">Catholic News Live Mobile App</a>. You can buy the app for your Android-powered device on the Android Market: <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.midwesternmac.cnl">Catholic News Live</a>.

The Android version joins the iOS version that's been out for about a year now, as well as the website, all three in combination allowing you to follow the latest Catholic News wherever you are, on whatever platform you use! <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/about/mobile-app">Read more about the Catholic News Live mobile app »</a>

Here are a few screenshots from the app on an Android phone:

I'll probably write more about Android development over on my <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/blogs">Midwestern Mac, LLC blog</a> in the coming weeks, but don't expect much right now—I'm quite busy with flockNote and some other projects :)
