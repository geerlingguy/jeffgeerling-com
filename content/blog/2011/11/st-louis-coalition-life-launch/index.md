Last night I was in attendance at <a href="http://www.40daysforlife.com/Stlouis/">40 Days for Life St. Louis</a>' Benefit dinner, and was happy to hear about a new initiative, the <a href="http://www.coalitionforlifestl.com/">St. Louis Coalition for Life</a>, to help put an end abortion in St. Louis (and Missouri!), and to raise awareness about other life issues.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.coalitionforlifestl.com/">{{< figure src="./coalition-for-life.png" alt="Coalition for Life Logo" width="240" height="116" class="blog-image" >}}</a></p>
Browse around their <a href="http://www.coalitionforlifestl.com/">website</a> and check out some of their <a href="http://www.coalitionforlifestl.com/get-involved/events-calendar/">upcoming events</a>. This coming year, the 39th since the passage of Roe vs. Wade, promises to be interesting, as Missouri is one of the states with only one Planned Parenthood providing abortion 'services' (the one at Forest Park Pkwy in the Central West End.

The Coalition for Life will be working with the Archdiocese's <a href="http://archstl.org/respectlife">Respect Life Apostolate</a>, <a href="http://www.thrivestlouis.org/">Thrive</a>, <a href="http://birthrightstlouis.org/">Birthright</a>, <a href="http://stlprojectjoseph.org/">Project Rachel</a>, etc. in their efforts.
