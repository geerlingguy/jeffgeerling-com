As we approach Christmas, I tried to think of a few gifts that others like me (namely, Catholic web developers and online content producers) could use to help them become more effective in their work.

I came up with a list of items ranging from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385508190/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmjjg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0385508190">Catholic Catechism</a> (I'm surprised by how many of my Catholic friends don't have a copy yet) to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052G679K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmjjg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0052G679K">the Glif</a>—a tiny but great tripod mount and stand for the iPhone 4/4S—and posted them on Open Source Catholic: <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/jeff-geerling/catholic-developers-c">The Catholic Developer and Blogger Christmas Wish List 2011</a>.

Since a few people insist on buying gifts for Christmas, I always like to think of gift ideas that would be truly appreciated and useful, rather than simply things I or others like myself would want only for fun. Hopefully this list gives <em>you</em> a little inspiration!
