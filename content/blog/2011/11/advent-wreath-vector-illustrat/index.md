I was recently inspired by <a href="http://www.splendoroftruth.com/curtjester/2011/11/my-annual-advent-service/">Jeffrey Miller's embeddable Advent Wreath widget</a> to try my hand at illustrating and animating an advent wreath in HTML5 with the &lt;canvas&gt; element or by animating an SVG.

My heart was in it for a while, but I ultimately gave up on the project due to the fact that I had already spent a couple hours on it and wasn't happy with my progress...

However, I did end up with a fairly good illustrator/vector wreath and candles (I spent a bit of time trying to get the flames looking just right), and also created a brush to create the actual wreath, making it look somewhat like an evergreen wreath.

I could spend a bit more time making things look a little nicer (everything's relatively flat right now), but I thought I'd just release this artwork for anyone to use and improve. I just ask that if you make something awesome with it, you let me know how you did it and give a link to an example :)

You can download the brush and the wreath graphic using the links at the bottom of this post.
