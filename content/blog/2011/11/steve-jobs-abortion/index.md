Steve Jobs, reflecting on a visit to his biological mother, who gave him up for adoption after having him in a non- married relationship with a man who didn't want a baby:

<blockquote>[Steve] wanted to reassure Joanne that what she'd had done was all right. "I wanted to meet my biological mother mostly to see if she was okay and to thank her, because I'm glad I didn't end up as an abortion. She was twenty-three and she went through a lot to have me" (Steve Jobs, p. 254).</blockquote>

Salient thoughts on the topic, coming from a guy who was simply grateful his mother gave him a shot at life; out of every difficult situation, a good thing may come.
