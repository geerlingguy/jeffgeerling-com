I got an email from <a href="http://secure.hostgator.com/cgi-bin/affiliates/clickthru.cgi?id=geerling">HostGator</a> yesterday alerting me to some really awesome deals for their web hosting services; for Cyber Monday, they're giving half off pretty much all their hosting plans:

<ul>
	<li>Shared hosting: As low as $4.95 Now only: <strong>$2.48</strong></li>
	<li>Reseller Hosting: As low as $24.95 Now Only: <strong>$12.48</strong></li>
	<li>VPS Hosting: As low as $19.95 Now Only: <strong>$9.98</strong></li>
	<li>Dedicated Servers: As low as $174 Now Only <strong>$87</strong></li>
</ul>

I've been using HostGator for a few of my less-trafficed websites for over three years now, and have had less than 10 minutes of measured downtime. I also use a cheap shared hosting plan to simply store backups of my other sites (they give you limited SSH access to cheap plans—which is awesome!).

I highly recommend HostGator; unlike most other low-cost hosts, their support team is top-notch, their plans are priced perfectly, and their servers (even for cheap shared hosting) are super-fast, compared to other hosts I've used (1&amp;1, GoDaddy, Dreamhost, etc.).

Please consider using <a href="http://secure.hostgator.com/cgi-bin/affiliates/clickthru.cgi?id=geerling">my HostGator affiliate link</a> to sign up for the best deal you're ever (probably) going to get for website hosting.

<em>This deal will only last for one day (Monday, November 27, 2011).</em> Even if you don't sign up today, think about HostGator for your hosting needs. They're good enough that I have recommended their hosting to almost every one of my small business clients throughout the years.
