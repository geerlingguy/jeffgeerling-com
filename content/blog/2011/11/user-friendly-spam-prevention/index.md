...such is the title of <a href="http://denver2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/user-friendly-spam-prevention">my session proposal</a> for <a href="http://denver2012.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Denver 2012</a>. I'm aiming the presentation at beginners, but it should be helpful for anyone with a Drupal site that has fought the battle with spammers—and lost.

Since I've had experience building and maintaining a variety of sites, from small blogs with a few posts a week, to large community sites with hundreds of posts and user accounts created per day, I figured I would try to share some of my experiences and what worked and what didn't. I hope to talk about the importance of keeping your site's user experience (UX) first, while still fighting off spammers, and then speaking about particular use cases and solutions.

I wrote up a post titled "<a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/articles/web-design/2011/preventing-form-spam">Preventing Form Spam</a>" on my personal website summarizing a lot of what I'd be talking about; if you want to hear more, please vote for my session, <a href="http://denver2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/user-friendly-spam-prevention">User-friendly spam prevention</a>, on the DrupalCon Denver website! (Hurry—voting ends November 14!). See you in Denver!
