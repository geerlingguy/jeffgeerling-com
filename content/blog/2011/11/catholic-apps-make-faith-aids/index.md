I'd be remiss to not mention a very well-written article in the Denver Catholic Register by Julie Filby: <a href="http://www.archden.org/index.cfm/ID/7069">Catholic apps make faith aids mobile</a>.

In the article, Julie does a great job explaining apps and their growing prominence in the lives of the faithful, along with some tips from Mark Hart and I:

<blockquote>Today’s technology offers Catholics many tools for praying, communicating and learning about their faith. One such tool comes in the form of “apps.” [...]

While members of the younger generation used to be the primary users of apps, driving sales and popularity; today all age groups are using them.</blockquote>

This market is still a moving target, and I'm anticipating some great new apps for the faithful—as well as some great updates to old ones—in the coming months. In fact, thanks to the generosity of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kliftonjk">@kliftonjk</a>, I have two Android devices on which I'm developing an Android version of <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/">Catholic News Live</a>!
