<p><a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/visibility">{{< figure src="./Visibility-Icon-128.png" alt="Visibility Icon" class="blog-image" >}}</a>I just released <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/visibility">Visbility</a>, a simple Mac application that makes showing and hiding invisible files easy, via Midwestern Mac, LLC.</p>
<p>I created this app for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#39;d never programmed in Objective-C before, so I wanted to test the waters.</li>
<li>I wanted to go through the process of submitting an App to the Mac App Store (crossing my fingers as to whether I would be able to get the App approved or not).</li>
<li>I wanted an easier (and less buggy) way to show invisible files in the Finder on my Macs.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the past, I&#39;ve used a few different AppleScripts to show or hide files in the Finder, and they were all lacking in some way or another&mdash;one would lock up sometimes, another would take two or three clicks to get the files to show or hide again, etc.</p>
<p>Visibility is very fast (startup, toggle, and quit), looks nice, and runs on 10.6 Snow Leopard.</p>
<p>Alas, it was rejected from the App Store for changing Finder preferences... but that&#39;s okay&mdash;now it&#39;s a free app for all to enjoy! Check out <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/visibility">Visibility&mdash;the easiest way to show invisible files on a Mac</a>.</p>
