<p>I&#39;ve had a DVD from Prometheus Entertainment/History Channel sitting on my desk for a year and a half, and I had almost forgotten why I had it by the time I finally sat down to watch the DVD. The DVD is of the show &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C68WNW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmjjg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C68WNW">Angels &amp; Demons Decoded</a>,&quot; which aired on the History Channel on May 10, 2009.</p>
<p>While I was watching a part about Bernini&#39;s artwork, I noticed a photo of the <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/photos/2009/1205"><strong>&#39;West Ponente&#39;</strong> direction marker in St. Peter&#39;s Square</a>&nbsp;very similar to mine at 1:08:12 &mdash; this wasn&#39;t my photo, but was close enough a match to warrant further inspection.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the documentary, when the narrator was talking of the interaction between faith and science in the Church, I found my image at about 1:28:35:</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./monstrance-image-angels-demons-decoded.jpg" alt="Monstrance Image in Angels &amp; Demons Decoded" width="600" height="322" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
<p>Whoever did the matte on that image (a) had a lot of patience, and (b) is quite good at it! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever attempted to cut out such an intricate photo.</p>
<p>You can view the original photo on Flickr here: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/5378708018/">Eucharistic Adoration - Monstrance</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m glad I was finally able to sit down and watch the show. I also watched <em>Angels &amp; Demons</em> (the actual movie) on Netflix, and thought it was a heck of a lot better (all around) than <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>. But it&#39;s still not a greatly historically-accurate film, in my opinion; like most Hollywood flicks, the director and producers played fast and loose with many theories and historical fact. But I don&#39;t let it ruffle my feathers :)</p>

<p>Luckily for me, the producers of the show actually asked my permission to use the photo, so I&#39;m not complaining about its use. Plus, at the end, they gave recognition where it&#39;s due:</p>
