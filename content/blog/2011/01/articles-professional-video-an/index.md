<p>In the past few months, I&#39;ve finally had time to post more information about two projects I&#39;ve worked on in the past year or so at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis&mdash;both of them having to do with the sending and receiving of video and audio signals through a very large building.</p>
<p>Click one of the titles to read the article:</p>
<h3><a href="/articles/audio-video/xlr-mic-level-balanced-audio-over-cat5e">XLR over Cat5 - Balanced XLR Mic/Line Audio over Cat5e</a></h3>
<p>In this article, I explain how we sent crystal-clear audio (used for both communication/VOX and broadcast TV) over a distance of about 300&#39; using nothing but shielded Cat5e cable. Pictures, diagrams, etc. included.</p>
<h3><a href="/articles/audio-and-video/2011/sending-high-definition-video">Sending High-Definition Video over Long Distances with Cat5</a></h3>
<p>In this article, I explain how we sent very sharp high definition video (up to 1080p) over about 100&#39; using component video baluns and shielded Cat5e cable. (You can also use these baluns to send digital/coax audio).</p>
<p>I truly believe Cat5e cable to be the most versatile cable on the planet. It can be used for almost any kind of data or signal, and is extremely cheap over long distances, in comparison to most other cable types.</p>
