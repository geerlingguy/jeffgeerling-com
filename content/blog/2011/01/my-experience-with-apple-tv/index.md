<p>I&#39;ve only been using the Apple TV for a few days now, but I have used it enough to jot down a few first impressions. I&#39;ll likely do a full-on review at some point in the future.</p>
<p class="rtecenter">{{< figure src="./apple-tv-2010-black.jpeg" alt="Apple TV (2010 - Black)" width="108" height="81" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
<p>Some of the things I really, really like about the ATV (I have the black/2010 model):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disappearing act</strong>: This thing is tiny, and it&#39;s black. I hate seeing anything besides my speakers and my TV, and the Apple TV is much better at hiding in my cabinet than my now-RROD Xbox 360. Oh, and it&#39;s silent.</li>
<li><strong>Surround Sound, HD, Effortless</strong>: It&#39;s awesome to finally be able to stream all my movies (HD or not) from my Mac with 5.1 digital surround. So awesome. (See my article on <a href="/articles/audio-and-video/2010/ripping-movies-blu-ray-and-dvd">how to rip Blu-Rays and DVDs and get them to work with the Apple TV and other devices</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Speed, Wireless N</strong>: Since I have an AirPort Express with 802.11n networking and a decent Internet connection, everything is fast&mdash;watching videos on YouTube, popping around the system, browsing my computer&#39;s movie and music library. Awesome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some things I don&#39;t like all that much, but will definitely live with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2690809&amp;tstart=150">You have to have iTunes and your Mac on at all times to share to the Apple TV</a>: Hopefully Apple will find a way to sell me another device to store all my content off-Mac so I&#39;m not burning an extra 100W when my computer is serving up content.</li>
<li>No 1080p: Not a deal-breaker for me, as I have a 720p 42&quot; TV, but someday, I&#39;ll upgrade, and want those extra pixels.</li>
<li>Harmony Remotes don&#39;t work out-of-the-box with the Apple TV: Still takes some time to have to program the remote manually if you want everything to work correctly. Ah well.</li>
</ul>
