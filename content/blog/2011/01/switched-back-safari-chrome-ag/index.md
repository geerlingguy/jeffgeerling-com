<p>{{< figure src="./chrome-no-more.jpg" alt="Google Chrome No More" class="blog-image" >}}Google lit up the hornet&#39;s nest yesterday when they announced that they were <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html">dropping built-in support of H.264 for their own &#39;open&#39; WebM and OGG video formats</a>.</p>
<p>I reconfigured <a href="http://www.xmarks.com/">Xmarks</a> on all my computers (to sync all my bookmarks between FireFox, Safari and Chrome), and I&#39;m back to using Safari full-time, with FireFox as my main backup. (FF 4.0 can&#39;t come soon enough).</p>
<p>It was good knowing ye, Chrome. I actually had my sights set on using Chrome indefinitely until yesterday.</p>
<p>(One of the many reasons I detest this decision by Google is that I have tested the waters of using WebM and/or OGG video for some web projects (using the HTML5 video tag), and found it sorely lacking, and a major pain to even <em>attempt</em> to use.* If I&#39;m having so much trouble getting video into this ridiculous format, how can I ever expect my Mom/Sister/Friend/Brother/whomever is not as tech-y as I to do it?!).</p>
<p><strong>Google: Please rescind your decision.</strong> For the good of the web, and for the good of my 500+ already encoded videos, and for the good of web developers, video content producers, and device makers everywhere.</p>
<p>For anyone else switching from another browser to Safari, here are a few tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://www.xmarks.com/">Xmarks</a> to sync your bookmarks. It&#39;s awesome.</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://alexstaubo.github.com/keywurl/">Keywurl</a> to search from Safari&#39;s address bar - it&#39;s even better than the &#39;wonder bar&#39; or whatever it&#39;s called in Chrome. (<a href="http://hacketal.com/making-keywurl-work-with-safari-5">How to install for Safari 5</a>).</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://extensions.apple.com/">Ultimate Status Bar</a> extension for Safari, and ditch the status bar. It&#39;s also awesome.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only thing I love about Chrome that I can&#39;t do with Safari is use the Shift+Command+N shortcut to quickly open a &#39;private browsing&#39; window. Oh well.</p>
<p><em>Just six months ago, <a href="/blog/2010/why-im-switching-back-chrome">I switched from Chrome to Safari when 5.0 was released</a>... but then I switch back to Chrome again for it&#39;s private browsing keyboard shortcut (I used that a lot for website anonymous user testing...). Now back to Safari!</em></p>
