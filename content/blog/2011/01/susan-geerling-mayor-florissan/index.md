Just a heads up, and a shout out to those living in Florissant (Flo-town, as it's endearingly called by those not in it, but cool enough to admit they were born there): my mother, <a href="http://geerlingformayor.com/">Susan Geerling, is running for mayor of the city of Florissant</a>!

I believe—nay, I guarantee—she has the city's best interests in mind, and I will be helping her to become the next mayor of a city I'm proud to call my birthplace. Though many may fault her for being honest, genuine, and logical in her decision-making processes (as was evidenced time and time again during her work as Ward 1 Councilwoman), I think these are virtues. Virtues worthy of the office of mayor.

Check out her website—<a href="http://geerlingformayor.com/">GeerlingForMayor.com</a>*—as well as her presences on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/geerlingformayor">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/susangeerling">Twitter</a>!

I'm proud of you, Mom! I know you can weather the storm of the electoral race, and improve an even greater part of the great city of Florissant than you did in the turn of this century!
