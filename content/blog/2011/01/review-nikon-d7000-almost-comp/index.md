<p>{{< figure src="./nikon-d7000-front.jpg" alt="Nikon D7000 - Front" class="blog-image" >}}Since about a week after it&#39;s introduction, I&#39;ve been shooting with the D90 as my primary camera, and it&#39;s been a great run. The D90 is almost the perfect photo-making machine for me. I was thinking of either upgrading to a D300s, or possibly a D700 (all my lenses would work with either FX or DX), but then came the D7000.</p>
<p>I was instantly thrilled with the specs, especially since the D7000 body is almost exactly the same dimensions as the D90 (meaning I wouldn&#39;t need to get used to a bunch of new button placements). So, after a little consultation with my bride, I bought the D7000 (it was in stock, momentarily, from Amazon.com).</p>
<p>I have been playing around with it today, making pictures and videos, and I must say that I am very happy with the upgrade&mdash;a lot has changed between the D90 and D7000... and most of it is under the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Check out my <a href="/review/photography/nikon-d7000">full review of the Nikon D7000</a></strong>, which includes the following videos:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dASwIjhc9O4">D7000 with External Lavaliere Microphone</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ll be filling in the blanks over the next few days. The big test (for me) comes in May, when I&#39;ll be shooting priestly ordinations in the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis (see some <a href="/photos/galleries/2010-priesthood-ordination">older pictures, taken with a D3, here</a>)&mdash;a venue that throws off even the venerable D3&#39;s white balance, sensor sensitivity, etc.</p>
