<p>{{< figure src="./rrod-xbox-shirt.jpg" alt="Achievement Unlocked - Red Ring of Death (Xbox 360 T-Shirt)" class="blog-image" >}}About a month ago, when I was settling down with my wife to watch a quick episode of Cake Boss via Netflix, I turned on the Xbox 360, but all the sudden, I received (for the third time on this Xbox) a nice present from Microsoft: the dreaded red ring of death (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems">RROD</a>).</p>
<p>&quot;Not to fear!&quot; said I, &quot;I&#39;ll get a free warranty repair, like I did the first two times this happened!&quot;</p>
<p>Little did I know. Luckily, however, I found a guy via Craigslist who repairs Xboxes and lives in St. Peters, MO (not too far from here!).</p>
<p>He has a small website (<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/thexbox360repair/">Xbox 360 Repair</a>) with a little information about his repair process, but the bottom line is that he charges only $35 (and nothing&mdash;$0&mdash;if he can&#39;t fix it) to take a sad Xbox 360 and turn it into a happy Xbox 360. And he does the repair right&mdash;he uses a solder reflow machine to fix the broken connections between the Xbox 360&#39;s GPU and the motherboard, then turns up the fan speed to compensate for the overworked GPU.</p>
<p>Just wanted to post the information here for (a) my own future reference&mdash;the thing will likely break again!&mdash;and (b) for anyone else in the St. Louis area who has a broken Xbox 360. Because for some people it&#39;s an addition... and who wants to live in the real world when Xbox LIVE is calling? ;-)</p>
