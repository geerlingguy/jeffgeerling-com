<p class="rtecenter"><a href="http://drupal.org/start">{{< figure src="./get-started-drupal-7.jpeg" alt="Get Started with Drupal 7" class="blog-image" >}}</a></p>
<p>Today, January 5, Drupal version 7.0 was released (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/drupal">download Drupal here</a>). Drupal 7 <a href="http://www.drupal7releaseparty.org/">release parties</a> will be held worldwide on January 7 (which also happens to be my birthday - yay!).</p>
<p>Congratulations to the team of <a href="http://growingventuresolutions.com/blog/contributors-drupal-7-final-numbers">almost 1,000 developers</a> who helped make Drupal 7 a reality, and congratulations to <a href="http://buytaert.net/">Dries Buytaert</a>, the founder of Drupal, and <a href="http://www.webchick.net/">webchick</a>, the person who shepherded (and continues herding) the community as the Drupal 7 core maintainer!</p>
<p>This website is still running on Drupal 6, but I&#39;m slowly beginning the process of redesigning and upgrading the rest of my sites (notably, so far, <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/">Midwestern Mac, LLC</a>) to Drupal 7. The <a href="http://archstl.org/">Archdiocesan website</a> and <a href="http://stlouisreview.com/">St. Louis Review</a> will take a bit longer, since there&#39;s a lot of custom code that needs to be refactored.</p>
<p>If you run a website, have you checked out Drupal before? It&#39;s a lot more extensible (in my experience) than Joomla or Wordpress, the two other top contenders. If it&#39;s good enough for large sites like the <a href="http://drupal.org/whitehouse-gov-launches-on-drupal-engages-community">White House</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/701104">Examiner.com</a>, it&#39;s good enough for you ;-)</p>
