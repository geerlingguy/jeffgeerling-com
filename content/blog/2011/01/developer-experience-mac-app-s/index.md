<p>This year, one of my resolutions is to become a more experienced programmer&mdash;not only in web development (I can hold my own with PHP, server scripting, and web design languages)&mdash;and one of the measurable achievements I&#39;d like to accomplish is having apps on the Mac App Store and iOS App Store.</p>
<p>I submitted a new Mac App, <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/visibility">Visibility</a>*, on January 9, and was hoping the app might be reviewed quickly so I could experience a few days on the Mac App store soon after its launch. Well, after more than two weeks of waiting, the App is still &#39;Waiting for Review.&#39;</p>
<p>Following the advice of some other developers on Apple&#39;s Developer Forums, I submitted an expedited app review support ticket... and didn&#39;t get a response for over a week!</p>
<p>From the response email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for your email and feedback. In order to get as many developers into the Mac App Store as possible we are reviewing apps on a first-come first-served basis. The size of any individual app or its fixes do not have an impact on when the app will enter In Review state.</p>
<p>We will get to your application as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>If your update is for a critical bug fix (reproducible crashes, for&nbsp;example), we can expedite a review. To do so, please let us know how we can&nbsp;reproduce this issue so we can confirm the resolution during our review.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m in agreement with some other developers who are getting restless about their Mac App Store development timeframes&mdash;if there&#39;s no way to know how long it will take to get an app, or even an update to an already-submitted app, to the store, how can we commit resources to developing for the Mac App Store? It has taken many developers over a month to get their Apps approved.</p>
<p>Hopefully Apple will accelerate the approval process soon... or at least offer developers an estimated timeline for approval!</p>
