<p>I just had dinner last night with a great young Catholic, Seth DeMoor, who is from Colorado and runs a (relatively) new Catholic website, <a href="http://onebillionstories.com/">One Billion Stories.com</a>.</p>
<p>The website has a pretty simple premise: go around the world, collecting stories of some of the billion-plus Catholics, and post them as five-minute videos to the website.</p>
<p>Seth seems like he has a pretty good idea, and the videos cover a lot of great stories. I like the idea, and I hope Seth can find more support, video producers, etc. in the coming years! Maybe, someday, the site will have over a billion stories&mdash;but for now, I&#39;m content with the few hundred that are up.</p>
