<p>{{< figure src="./mac-app-store-icon.png" alt="Mac App Store Icon - Logo" class="blog-image" >}}This might just be too crazy to be true, but I just thought, after reading that some of the bestselling games for the Mac were <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/01/14/call-of-duty-4-and-civilization-iv-colonization-hit-the-mac-app-store/">added</a> to the Mac App Store, if there might be an ulterior motive to the Mac App Store...</p>
<p>Besides adding some revenue to Apple&#39;s bottom line, offering a convenient means to Mac users discovering and purchasing new software, and making the Mac more in-line with the iOS device philosophy, what if Steve walked into an Apple retail store one day last year and said:</p>
<p class="rteindent1">&quot;I really like the entrance to this store. There&#39;s something magical about it. Every product we display in this physical space is our own, and it exudes beauty.&quot;</p>
<p class="rteindent1">Johnny Ive then says, &quot;Yeah, mate. That&#39;s exactly why we made it this way.&quot;</p>
<p class="rteindent1">Steve continues, though, &quot;But look beyond... do you see that wall back there? Look at all those disgusting, multi-colored boxes of cardboard and plastic. Shades of blue, red, yellow... nothing matches. Let&#39;s get rid of it. Right now.&quot; [Steve is here referring to the wall of third-party software for the Mac].</p>
<p class="rteindent1">Tim Cook replies, &quot;Alright, Steve-o. I see what you&#39;re saying... but let&#39;s not be too hasty. It will take a few months for people to get used to buying software on their Macs... plus, Lion&#39;s not out yet! Let&#39;s wait a few months, but we&#39;ll do it.&quot;</p>
<p class="rteindent1">Steve concludes, &quot;Fine, fine. Let&#39;s get this done now... and don&#39;t worry too much about the developers&mdash;I just sent out a batch of our finest kool-aid.&quot;</p>
<p>I could definitely imagine this happening.</p>
