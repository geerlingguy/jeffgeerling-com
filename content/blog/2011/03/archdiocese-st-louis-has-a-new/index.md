<strong>I'm happy to announce that my first iPhone App—<a href="http://archstl.org/mobile-app">Catholic STL</a>—</strong>has been accepted by Apple for the iTunes App Store, and is available for free starting today!
<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./iphone-app-icon-small.jpg" alt="Archstl Mobile App - Catholic STL Icon" width="125" height="125" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
The Archdiocese of St. Louis also announced the App this morning, and has a '<a href="http://archstl.org/mobile-app">mobile app</a>' section on the website with screenshots, an introductory video, and more information about the App. The App is free, so what are you waiting for? If you live in St. Louis, or are visiting, go ahead and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/catholic-stl-archdiocese-st/id422420472?mt=8">download it now</a>.

The App basically lets users find parishes and sacrament times/parish information in the first section, read news in the second section, and read and post prayer requests on the Archdiocesan website in the third section.

I've also published some <a href="http://archstldev.com/story/2011/designing-and-buildi">information about the App's development</a> on the Archdiocesan Development website, and will likely be posting more news on the development front at some point in the next month or two. (I'm thinking about open sourcing the code we used for the Archdiocesan App, so other dioceses/Archdioceses could, at least, get some ideas for their own apps).

What do you think? Post questions or feature requests here or on the Development website, and be sure to rate the App on the App Store after you've downloaded and used it!
