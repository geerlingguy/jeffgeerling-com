Just a little bit of an overview of a couple things I'm working on / where I've been:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Super-top-secret... er... not-so-secret iPhone app about to be released</strong>
I've been working on a <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/about/mobile-app">Catholic News Live app</a> for a couple weeks now, and I've submitted version 1.0.0 to the App Store—it's just awaiting approval before it will be for sale for the low, low price of $0.99!</li>
	<li><strong>JJGWebView Class released on GitHub</strong>
My second bit of code released on GitHub is a <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/JJGWebView">UIWebView controller and class</a> (and demo implementation) for the iPhone and iPod Touch (iPad support coming soon, I hope), hosted on GitHub. More details here: <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/jjgwebview">JJGWebView in-app browser class</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>DrupalCon is Over</strong>
I was in Chicago all week for <a href="http://chicago2011.drupal.org/">DrupalCon</a>. It was awesome. My first DrupalCon (of, I hope, many!) started off with a bang. It was great to see many of the people I interact with online, in person. Tomorrow I might be able to meet up with one or two more Drupal devs, before I head back to St. Louis. You can see my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/sets/72157626098204251/">pictures from DrupalCon on Flickr</a>.</li>
</ul>

More to come on the Catholic News Live app, once it's approved by Apple. I already have an update almost ready to push to the App Store after version 1.0.0 is approved. The update will fix a bug or two, and might add a really nice new feature I was trying to get in the first release :-)

Suffice it to say, it will be the best Catholic news app for the iPhone and iPod Touch. Someday maybe the iPad, too!
