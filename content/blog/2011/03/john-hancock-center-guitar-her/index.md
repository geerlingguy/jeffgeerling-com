I couldn't pass up this photo op. Foggy nights in downtown Chicago are great!

<p style="text-align: left;">I'm in Chicago for the week for <a href="http://chicago2011.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Chicago 2011</a>—it's been a great conference, though the weather's been pretty stiff. Maybe I'll have time to waltz around the city a little more tomorrow evening...</p>
