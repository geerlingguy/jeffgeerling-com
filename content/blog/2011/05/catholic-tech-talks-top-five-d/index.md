{{< figure src="./archstl-screenshot.jpg" alt="Archdiocese of St. Louis - Screenshot" width="275" height="211" class="blog-image" >}}Catholic Tech Talk, a Catholic tech/web discussion website, recently posted what they believe to be the <a href="http://catholictechtalk.com/blog/2011/05/21/the-5-best-diocesan-websites/">five best Catholic Diocesan websites</a>, and I'm happy to report that our very own <a href="http://archstl.org/">Archdiocese of St. Louis</a> was ranked #2!

Other dioceses to make the list:

<ol>
	<li><a href="http://bostoncatholic.com/">Archdiocese of Boston</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://archstl.org/">Archdiocese of St. Louis</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.archspm.org/">Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.dioceseoftrenton.org/">Diocese of Trenton</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.dioceseofscranton.org/">Diocese of Scranton</a></li>
</ol>

I am, and will always be, honored to have had the opportunity to <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2011/a-new-job">work with the Archdiocese of St. Louis</a> for a few years, and that website was pretty much the lion's share of my work with them. Through my many posts sharing information about how I built the site on <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/">Open Source Catholic</a> and elsewhere, I hope other dioceses can take some of the ideas from archstl.org and expand on them, making even better websites in its wake!

The founder of Catholic Tech Talk, Craig Berry, interviewed me a week or so ago for the CTT podcast (<a href="http://catholictechtalk.com/blog/2011/05/17/ctt-podcast-004-interview-with-jeff-geerling/">CTT Podcast 004 - Interview with Jeff Geerling</a>)—I talked with him about my work in the Archdiocese, Archdiocesan web development in general, and my new role at flockNote. Suffice it to say, I'm not finished trying to help the Church leap forward in its online communications effort!
