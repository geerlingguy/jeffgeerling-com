My wife came back from the grocery store today and recounted a heartwarming interaction with the bagger in the checkout line:

<blockquote>Wife: "I like that you're always so happy and smiling."

Bagger: "Well, I just like living, you know? Jesus is nice. Things are working out good."</blockquote>

I think this would be a pretty good prayer of thanksgiving during this consumeristic season.
