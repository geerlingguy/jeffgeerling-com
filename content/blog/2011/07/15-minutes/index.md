I don't know what it is about today, but my name was mentioned on three separate sites! I guess that's what I get for my infrequent blogging, dropping behind on <a href="http://www.lolsaints.com/">LOLSaints</a> postings, and general lack of updates around the web over the past few weeks (I'm plugging away like gangbusters on <a href="http://www.flocknote.com/">flockNote</a> v3!)...

<h4>The Crescat</h4>

One of my favorite Catholic blogs, by a great margin - <a href="http://thecrescat.blogspot.com/2011/07/required-reading-after-all.html">The Crescat mentioned an OSV article</a> (which I had almost forgotten about—that's how much my mind is focused on work right now!), and was pretty inflated after reading that I 'religiously' follow her musings. Still haven't met the lady, but I have a friend and former co-worker who I imagine to be her nefarious (I kid!) twin sister from St. Louis. You know who you are!

<h4>OSV - Guide to the Internet</h4>

Speaking of OSV... here's the article: <a href="http://www.osv.com/tabid/7621/itemid/8230/OSV-Guide-to-the-Internet-40.aspx">The OSV Guide to the Internet 4.0</a>. Some great resources within, and you can even download the PDF of the pages from the publication within.

<h4>The Curt Jester</h4>

Speaking of funny blogs that I follow religiously... Jeff Miller over at The Curt Jester <a href="http://www.splendoroftruth.com/curtjester/2011/07/what-might-purgatory-be-like-for-catholic-bloggers/">extended</a> an already side-splittingly fun <a href="http://actsoftheapostasy.blogspot.com/2011/07/bloggurgatory.html">list of punishments</a> various Catholic bloggers might face in purgatory (believe me, we bloggers are gonna get a lot of extra time up there for all the procrastination-time we rack up!).

What a day! Well, now that that's up, back to flockNote... a LOT more to come on that front, soon.

<em>P.S. Just created another Drupal module, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/honeypot">Honeypot</a>—the fruit of a few minutes' work on flocknote.com this morning :-)</em>
