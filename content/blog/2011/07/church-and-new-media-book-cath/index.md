I've heard about this book here and there the past few months, but it's getting all official now, with a <a href="http://www.churchandnewmedia.com/">spiffy website</a>, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyvimqExuSk">trailer</a> (hey, I thought only movies had those!), and <a href="http://www.churchandnewmedia.com/endorsements/">A-list endorsements</a>.

From the endorsements:

<blockquote>“This book demonstrates how New Media is already impacting the Church and outlines many practical steps for dioceses, parishes, and individual Catholics to embrace it more broadly…Everyone involved in Communications and Evangelization ministries for the Church should read it.” &nbsp;(–Cardinal Seán O'Malley, OFM Cap.)</blockquote>
