A shout-out to another one of my friends / former classmates, <a href="http://andysyring.com/">Rev. Syring</a>, from the Diocese of Omaha (Nebraska). He will be an amazing priest, and I was privileged to be able to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/sets/72157627115868854/with/5901906914/">photograph his first Mass</a> as a priest:

Please pray for our priests!
