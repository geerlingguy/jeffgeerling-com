Since I've started working full-time as a web developer a few years ago, I've probably spent more than 8 hours every workday (and a few hours most weekends) sitting perfectly still at a desk, moving only my fingers, and occasionally my arms, to type, move a mouse, and drink something here and there.

With reports that working standing up isn't really all it's made out to be (you still need to move around, and you're moving pressure points from your lower back to your lower legs...), and other reports stating that it's more about periodic movement and stretching that will help with&nbsp;musculoskeletal fitness, I've been thinking more about ways I can force myself to move.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/breaktime/id427475982?mt=12">{{< figure src="./breaktime-screenshot.jpg" alt="Breaktime App for Mac" width="550" height="343" class="blog-image" >}}</a></p>
I've finally found the perfect tool for this, and it's simple and easy to use, to boot! It's called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/breaktime/id427475982?mt=12">BreakTime</a>, and it's $2.99 on the Mac App Store.

The screenshot says it all, but once you use it for a day, you'll realize how quickly a 45-minute period can go by, and how infrequently you would move around without a tool like this. I try to get up, walk around my condo, do a stretch or two, and refill my water bottle, before sitting back down and hitting the Done button.

If you're like me, you <em>need</em> this app.
