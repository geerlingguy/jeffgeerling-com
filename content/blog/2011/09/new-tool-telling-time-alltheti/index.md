After staring at a todo in my inbox for a few weeks, I finally got around to doing it on the flight back from Boston yesterday. I simply wanted an easy, quick, at-a-glance way of telling what time it was in different timezones/cities around the US (and eventually around the world).

So, I created <strong><a href="http://alltheti.me/">Alltheti.me</a></strong>:

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alltheti.me/">{{< figure src="./allthetime-ipad.png" alt="Alltheti.me on the iPad" width="525" height="394" class="blog-image" >}}</a>
(as displayed on the iPad)</p>
I've been wanting something like this for quite some time, and I finally got a few hours to play around with dates and times in PHP and JavaScript. The times may not be quite right when viewed in certain timezones, so I'd appreciate if any friends from outside US Central time could tell me if their own times are correct.

I plan on adding a few small features and visual tweaks soon (right now it's pretty boring), but I really want to maintain the site's speed and simplicity. The reason I don't use any other sites for this purpose is because they're way too complex, offer way too many features, and are usually overridden by tons of ads.

Any other suggestions to make it more useful?&nbsp;
