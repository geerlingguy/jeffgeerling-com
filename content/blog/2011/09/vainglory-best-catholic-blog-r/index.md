Dustin Faber, formerly known as the 16-bit Catholic who posted awesome articles about gaming from the perspective of a Catholic about-to-be-married on <a href="http://dustinfaber.blogspot.com/">dustinfaber.com</a>, and now posts awesome articles about marriage (and maybe how it's like gaming, except way harder?) with his wife on <a href="http://thecatholiclovebirds.blogspot.com/">The Catholic Lovebirds</a>&nbsp;(wow, is this sentance long, or what?), has honored Life is a Prayer with the esteemed title of&nbsp;<strong><em>Best Catholic Blog to read on the Toilet</em></strong>.

I have to say that I'm truly flattered—I am no stranger to the throne, as I spend many hours there, pondering the fundamentals of life. Or watching Star Trek. Since I have Crohn's, there's always an opportunity for spiritual growth or sci-fi entertainment on the ol' iPad (I'm currently progressing through TNG season 3).

To see that someone else honors Life is a Prayer enough to spend some of his most focused time reading it is truly edifying.

But enough about me—check out Dustin's new blog, in which he and his wife Allicia chronicle their way through the Sacrament of Matrimony. Natalie and I still haven't <a href="/blog/2010/please-pray-us">fulfilled our promise</a> to share more of our marital progress on this blog and over at <a href="http://geerlingguyandgirl.com/">geerlingguyandgirl.com</a>, but it looks like we don't need to, if the Faber's keep up their site :-).
