I just finished my workshop presentation at the Catholic New Media Celebration entitled "Sanctifying Mobile Technology." I talked about some ideas I have to help Catholic parishes and organizations spread their mission through iPhones, iPads and other mobile devices.

My full presentation was recorded, but I don't have the video yet. However, I do have all the slides, and tons of links, over on the <a href="/articles/religion/2011/gadgets-gizmos-sanctifying-mob">presentation page here on Life is a Prayer.com</a>.

You can view <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/cnmc11/pool/">photos from CNMC '11</a> in the linked Flickr group.
