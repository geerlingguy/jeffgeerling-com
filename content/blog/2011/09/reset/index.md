Starting today, I'm going to be slowly working on:

<ol>
	<li>Upgrading some of my older sites to a newer version of Drupal.</li>
	<li>Rethinking where I post about certain things.</li>
</ol>

With regard to the latter point, I'm going to start focusing more on life, religion, philosophy, and such things on this particular blog, while I will focus more on technology (and web development in particular) on my <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/">Midwestern Mac, LLC site</a>.

I've hit a point where I think I'll start putting a few sites I maintain on mothballs (much like I have my old 2002-era <a href="http://jjjcl.jeffgeerling.com">Latin website</a>, the <a href="http://duel.jeffgeerling.com">Duel of the Seminarians site</a>, et all).
