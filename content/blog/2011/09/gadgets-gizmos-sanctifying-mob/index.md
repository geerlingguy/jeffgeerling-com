<h2>Mobile Technology for Your Organization</h2>

<h3>QR Codes</h3>

QR Codes are, simply, graphical representations of text. They are very helpful for mobile phone users, as they allow a person to quickly get to a URL, send a text message, make a phone call, or write an email, without worrying about typing in an address correctly.

<h4>QR Code Reader Apps</h4>

<ul>
	<li>iPhone: <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scan/id411206394?mt=8">Scan</a></li>
	<li>Android: <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.unveil&amp;hl=en">Google Goggles</a></li>
	<li>Blackberry: App World (built in)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Generating QR Codes</h4>

<h3>Registration and Mobile Donations</h3>

Getting people to sign up for something, or to register for your parish, is difficult. Make it easier for people by asking them to sign up on the spot, using nothing but their mobile phones!

Similarly, asking someone to donate money by check or cash can be difficult, considering many people don't carry around either payment methods. Instead, accept donations via text message, mobile sites, or with a card reader.

<h4>SMS Registration</h4>

<a href="http://www.flocknote.com/">flockNote</a> allows you to ask people to simply text your keyword to a certain phone number. flockNote will then ask people for their email addresses, and then get them fully registered with your organization.

<h4>Online Registration</h4>

You don't need anything fancy or expensive to allow people to send you their information. You can just set up a simple form using <a href="http://wufoo.com/">WuFoo</a>, <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/">SurveyMonkey</a>, or even an extension for Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, etc.

You can even have a QR code someone can scan on a phone instead of making the person type out a URL to the form, or go from one place to another to get to the form.

The key here? KISS - Keep it Simple, Stupid! When people are on their mobile phones, you don't want them spending too much time trying to figure out a form—they'll give up.

<h4>Mobile Donations &amp; Payments</h4>

Besides having a simple 'Donate' page on your website (make sure it works on mobile phones!), you could use one of the following innovative methods of accepting mobile donations and payments:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www2.obopay.com/merchant/text_to_pay.php">Text-to-Pay</a> [Obopay]</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.thepaypalblog.com/2010/08/donate-to-a-worthy-cause-with-paypal-mobile-for-iphone-2-5/">PayPal Mobile</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a> [CC acceptance]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Custom Mobile Apps</h3>

<a href="http://archstl.org/mobile-app">Catholic STL</a> was created by the Archdiocese of St. Louis to help it's many thousands of parishioners be able to find the sacraments, pray in community, and see what's happening. Your own Church, Diocese, or organization can have its own app, too!

If you don't have a programmer able to create an app for you, you have a few options:

<h4>Hire a Developer/Company</h4>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.littleiapps.com/">Little i Apps</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.travisboudreaux.com/">Travis Boudreaux</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.petrosmedia.com/">Petros Media</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://surgeworks.com/">Surgeworks</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Buy a prepackaged solution</h4>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.thechurchapp.org/">The Church App</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.r04r.com/">ROAR</a></li>
</ul>

I've posted all this information to the Open Source Catholic Wiki (<a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/wiki/117/mobile-app-development-re">link</a>), and if you have any more information or companies worth adding to these lists, please feel free to <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/wiki/117/mobile-app-development-re">edit that Wiki page</a> and add it!

<h3>DIY Podcasting &amp; Video Production</h3>

Podcasting gear and production of pro-caliber video doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg. Chances are you, or someone you know, has a smartphone able to record reasonable-quality HD video and audio.

While I focus on the iPhone 4, there are many other models of mobile phones that can be used with varying degrees of success when recording video and/or audio on the go (or at home).

Here are some resources I've put together for mobile A/V production:
