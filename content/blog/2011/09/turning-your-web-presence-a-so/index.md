<h4>by Matthew Warner</h4>

This presentation was given at the <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/">2011 Catholic New Media Conference</a>. Below are my notes on the presentation:

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Being 'present' isn't enough.</li>
	<li>Social media is about engaging people in a dialog; talking with them, listening to them, and RELATING.</li>
	<li>Don't get caught up in monetizing your blog/site.</li>
	<li>Don't get caught up in analytics and followers.</li>
	<li>Focus on the PEOPLE involved in your Network.</li>
	<li>"If you shoot for quantity at the expense of quality, you'll end up with neither."</li>
	<li>Build your network upon meaningful relationships.</li>
</ul>

<h4>P.O.S.T Method</h4>

<ul>
	<li>People: Who are you trying to reach?</li>
	<li>Objectives: Why? What are your Goals?</li>
	<li>Strategies: Ways to accomplish those goals?</li>
	<li>Technologies: What tools will help you do that?<!--break--></li>
</ul>

<h4>9 Basic Tips for Building Connections</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Use other social networks (and evaluate which ones will be helpful for your network).</li>
	<li>Ask people to connect (have it at the top of your page, have a little explanation of what they're going to get).</li>
	<li>Don't forget email. Many people want to stay informed...</li>
	<li>Twitter and Facebook embedded widgets.</li>
	<li>Make content sharable - give social media sharing links.</li>
	<li>Encourage social commenting - Livefyre, Disqus, Gravatar, etc.</li>
	<li>Use multimedia (with purpose). Don't just stick pictures in because you want a picture...</li>
	<li>Build a forum (not for everyone, though).</li>
	<li>Use a social media aggregator (like TweetDeck or Hootsuite).</li>
</ol>

<h4>Listening (and responding)</h4>

<ul>
	<li>People will send information your way... listen to comments, tweets, replies, etc.</li>
	<li>Listen outside of your official channels:

<ul>
	<li>Keywords (Google Alerts), watch competitors, follow hashtags, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>Always respond (if you can). Especially if someone reaches out to you specifically.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Making your content social</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Make it high quality (obvious, but requires continuous work).</li>
	<li>Make it entertaining.</li>
	<li>Don't say everything (leave room for other people).</li>
	<li>Ask questions of your community.</li>
	<li>Share you're goals - make it a 'we' endeavor.</li>
	<li>Talk about your events; add suspense and drama.</li>
	<li>Post as an individual, and not as an organization (if possible).</li>
	<li>Be yourself.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Social media pitfalls</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Don't let it kill productivity. Don't spread self too thin. Don't consume everything.</li>
	<li>Social media is not an end itself; it's a means with which you can accomplish your mission.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Keep it personal and value quality relationships.</li>
	<li>Have fun, be authentic, share your joy.</li>
	<li>Pray, hope and don't worry.</li>
</ul>
