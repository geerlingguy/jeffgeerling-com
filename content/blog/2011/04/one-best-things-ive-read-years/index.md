One of maybe 100 or so quotes I could pull from Orwell's 1946 essay, "<a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm">Politics and the English Language</a>:"

<blockquote>Political language—and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists—is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.</blockquote>

The essay also gives guidelines for modern English writers, explaining how to write concisely and eloquently. There are so many great sentences in that essay, it was hard to not simply copy and paste the whole thing here!

And, of course, Orwell wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451524934/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmjjg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0451524934">1984</a>, a book about <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-715862862672743260#">the year the Macintosh was introduced</a> (just kidding...).
