Since the announcements seem to be making the rounds today, I figured it would be a good time to post this little bit of news to my blog: I'm leaving my position in the Archdiocese of St. Louis to pursue another opportunity!

Starting May 2, I'll be working with a great new team of Catholics for <a href="http://www.flocknote.com/">flockNote</a>, a service/website for Catholic parishes and organizations to help register individuals and send them, well, "Notes!"

I've been working for the <a href="http://archstl.org/">Archdiocese of St. Louis</a> for almost three years, first in the Catholic Youth Apostolate, and for the last year as the Director of Web Development, and it's been a wonderful experience. I'd like to sincerely thank everyone in the Curia of the Archdiocese of St. Louis for some great professional development, wonderful memories, and for being in a very wonderful and Catholic workplace (we had Mass in the building almost every day that I was working there!).<!--break-->

During my time with the Archdiocese, I was privileged to help with the following:

<ul>
	<li>Rebuilding&nbsp;<a href="http://archstl.org/">archstl.org</a>, <a href="http://stlouisreview.com/">stlouisreview.com</a>, <a href="http://stlyouth.org/">stlyouth.org</a>, <a href="http://www.reapteam.org/">reapteam.org</a>, <a href="http://www.cycstl.net/">cycstl.net</a>,&nbsp;and many more websites.</li>
	<li>The announcement and installation of a <a href="http://archstl.org/archstl/page/archbishop-robert-j-carlson">new Archbishop</a> and a <a href="http://archstl.org/archstl/page/bishop-edward-m-rice">new Bishop</a>.</li>
	<li>The elevation of an <a href="http://archstl.org/archstl/page/raymond-leo-cardinal-burke">Archbishop Emeritus to a Cardinal</a> (hello to Archbishop Burke!).</li>
	<li><a href="http://archstl.org/mobile-app">Catholic STL</a> - a free iOS app for Catholics in the Archdiocese of St. Louis.</li>
	<li>Two <a href="http://celebration.sqpn.com/">Catholic New Media Celebrations</a> (San Antonio and Boston).</li>
	<li><a href="https://idcards.cycstl.net/">CYC ID Cards site</a> (allowing people to order and print their own ID cards online).</li>
</ul>

It has been an amazing and life-changing experience working for the Archdiocese... and in my personal life I also went through some huge changes: dating, engagement and <a href="/tags/marriage">marriage</a>, building a cool <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/about/mobile-app">Catholic news App</a>, starting up <a href="http://www.lolsaints.com/">LOLSaints.com</a>, collaborating with hundreds of other Catholic developers on <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/">Open Source Catholic</a>, and doing other amazing things.

And now, I'm going to be working as the Chief Technology Officer for flockNote. flockNote is a service that is (mainly) for Catholic parishes to help them 'connect with their flock.'

In the past 10 years, the trend for many software solutions and services has been a move 'to the cloud.' The same trend is beginning to appear in Church communications, and flockNote will be at the leading edge of communications tools built for parishes (and other Catholic organizations).

flockNote promises to make communication simple and effective. I'll be involved in some really awesome projects right out of the gate—and I'll be heavily involved in <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> hacking for the first couple months, at least!
