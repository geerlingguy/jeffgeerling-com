Dear Things developers (Cultured Code),

I know you are perfectionists. I know you're purists. Your software is inspirational, in a way. It's clean, it's fast, and it's functional. You make beautiful software, and I'm glad you've had such great success in the past.

But I have to say, "Goodbye."

The one and only feature that I've been waiting for—OTA sync—is still not here.

You've made some <a href="http://culturedcode.com/status/">pretty status indicators</a> telling me nothing, but impressing me nonetheless. You've posted some <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/blog/2010/12/state-of-sync-part-1.html">great</a> <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/blog/2011/01/state-of-sync-part-ii.html">developer</a> <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/blog/2011/03/state-of-sync-part-iii.html">stories</a> about this feature, but given no backbone to your words.

Two times in the past year I'd almost made up my mind to leave behind my $100 investment in your company, but two times I've waited. This, I fear, is the third strike. How can I ignore so many different people praising your competitor's software, but sit on the sidelines with nothing but hope and dreams of what could be?

Things, I will miss your beautiful, simple, functional interface. I hope you will take this lesson to heart: <a href="http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/">ship early, and ship often</a>. You can't string your users along forever.

Sincerely,
Jeff Geerling
