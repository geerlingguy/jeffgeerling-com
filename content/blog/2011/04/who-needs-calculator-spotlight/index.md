When I'm performing quick calculations or estimates, measuring things, or balancing my checkbook, I just hit Command + Spacebar, then type in what I need to know.
<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./spotlight-math.png" alt="Spotlight Math" width="361" height="121" >}}</p>


<ul>
	<li>1+1? (Spotlight gives the answer right away: 2)</li>
	<li>((1+1)/4*(232.2-28))+55? (Spotlight gives the answer right away: 157.1</li>
</ul>

Instant math... way better than any calculator or calculator app I've ever used... and it's always at my fingertips.

<strong>Bonus</strong>: press Command + C to copy the result to the clipboard. Awesome.
