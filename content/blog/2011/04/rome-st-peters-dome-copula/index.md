<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/5647825662/" title="Rome from Copula of St. Peters Basilica by geerlingguy, on Flickr">{{< figure src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5148/5647825662_634747d41e_z.jpg" alt="Rome from Copula of St. Peters Basilica" width="640" height="196" >}}</a></p>
This is a panorama shot from the top of St. Peters Basilica in Rome (the Cupola is the Dome).

The image is 9611x2937, and if you <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/5647825662/sizes/o/">view the original</a>, you can see details down to some of the furthest buildings—such as the two small domes of St. Maria Maggiore, the dome of the Pantheon, the 'Wedding Cake' (Monument to Vittorio Emmanuele II), and more! If you zoom in, you can also see the cars driving to and from St. Peter's Square.

I shot this image series on a stormy day in March with my Nikon D7000. I stitched the images together with Adobe Photoshop CS5.
