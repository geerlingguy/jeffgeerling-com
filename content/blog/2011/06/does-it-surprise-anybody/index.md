Does it surprise anybody that the only <em>woman</em> interviewed in <a href="http://www.fox2now.com/videobeta/?watchId=280b63f1-f5ec-45c9-8cbb-08974250339f">Fox 2 KTVI's video</a> about the Hooters/Catholic Charities fundraising event objected to the event?

What, might I ask, do <em>women</em> think about the fact that the exploitation of the female body is the primary money-maker for Hooters?
