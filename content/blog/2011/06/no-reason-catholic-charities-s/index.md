[<strong>Update</strong>: I just heard from a Catholic Charities employee that the CC president, Brian O'Malley, has cancelled the event. Great news! Hopefully this is the last time that crops up...].

I recently received an email from a friend (actually, I received a few emails, from a few different friends) advertising a fundraising dinner for St. Patrick Center (a Catholic Charities affiliated organization that does a lot of great things for the homeless and jobless in St. Louis).

The email advertises a dinner at Hooters, which will help raise funds for St. Patrick Center:

<blockquote>Dine &amp; Donate - Hooters in Kiener Plaza will donate a percentage of food sales to St. Patrick Center from any guest participating in the LAST Dine &amp; Donate event!</blockquote>

Screenshot of the email (<a href="http://stpatrickcenter.cmail2.com/t/ViewEmail/r/38EE2E91FBF14CBD/05BF4E498616B329DBC23BD704D2542D">which can be read online here</a>):

<p style="text-align: left;">I really don't think it's necessary that Catholic organizations patronize this dining establishment, no matter what the cause. I need not discuss why Hooters is not an organization in line with Catholic moral teachings on human sexuality—at least, I hope I don't need to...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I wonder how the decision could've been made to send out an email to hundreds (thousands?) of Catholics in St. Louis asking them to come and dine at Hooters for charity. I can understand this coming from a more secular organization, but not from Catholic Charities.</p>
