A couple weeks ago, as my kids settled into the car, I asked like I always do, "what songs do you want me to play?"

They have a range of favored earworms, from Baby Shark to Babaloo, and usually the songs are tolerable, at least.

But a few albums, like Bluey's soundtrack, transcend the children's genre. They're genuinely fun to listen to, for everyone in the car.

Well, that fine day, the kids chose Ladybug Music. And let me tell you, besides a few duds, Ladybug Music _slaps_. And the songs incorporate diverse styles, too, it's not just the same nursery rhymes regurgitated in a bubbly voice.

So I found the album on my phone and noticed the songs were all greyed out.

I tapped one, and _nothing_. Just this notice:

{{< figure src="./song-not-available.jpg" alt="Song not available Apple Music on iPhone" width="700" height="auto" class="insert-image" >}}

Not available in my region? Well, that's weird. I pay for Apple Music. And I know the artist is in the US, and _I'm_ in the US...

But my kids were restless, and we had somewhere to be, so I put on Pinkfong for the drive. After I got home, I went online to investigate.

> This blog post is a transcript of [this video on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDKvdlD6uQ).

Unfortunately, Ladybug music isn't a huge artist, so there wasn't any news coverage, like "thousands of parents cry out as their favorite kids songs disappear from Apple Music!"

But I _did_ find the [Ladybug Music website](https://ladybugmusic.com).

And on that website, they have a [shop](https://ladybugmusic.com/shop/). Great! I can just buy the CDs, and support the artist directly!

And... no. Apparently Ladybug music is now an app. So I downloaded the App! Long story short, I created an account, and found out you either have to fly to LA and join one of the in-person kids music courses, or pay [$3000 in licensing fees](https://ladybugmusic.com/licensing-application/) to get access to any of the songs.

> **Note**: I've also reached out to Ladybug Music using their contact form to ask about any other way to purchase the music, and have received no response.

No bueno.

Scrounging around, you can get a few free songs from their YouTube or Soundcloud, and on Amazon a couple of used CDs are floating around... but there's literally no way to buy the music online anymore!

This isn't the first time I've seen a song disappear from Apple Music. And this kind of thing happens on Spotify and other streaming services too.

I can't get _too_ mad, because I never actually "bought" those songs directly. I just rented them. That's the model for video streaming too, like on Netflix. Even though it's _super_ annoying to have shows and music disappear, I _am_ renting, so it's not like I have a _right_ to anything.

## Playstation

But that's just streaming. Luckily, you can also _buy_ digital movies and music, and you get to keep it.

Right?

_Right?_

Wrong.

Enshittification has reached new heights, as [Sony just decided to yoink over a _thousand seasons_](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/playstation-is-erasing-1318-seasons-of-discovery-shows-from-customer-libraries/)—that's right, _seasons_, not _episodes_—of Discovery shows from the PlayStation Store.

But they're not just removing them from the _store_.

They're removing them from people's _libraries_.

> As of 31 December 2023, due to our content licensing arrangements with content providers, you will no longer be able to watch any of your previously purchased Discovery content and the content will be removed from your video library. ([Source](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/psvideocontent/))

So if you paid full retail price for Mythbusters on your PlayStation, too bad. You can't watch it anymore.

That is, unless you go over and set up a new subscription to yet another completely unneccessary and broken streaming service from Warner Brothers.

The term for that is [_enshittification_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification).

I'm not gonna rehash [everything Cory Doctorow wrote](https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/08/playstationed/#tyler-james-hill) about this latest assault on digital ownership, but I'll summarize a few of the main things that get under my skin.

First, the headline: "If buying isn't owning, then piracy isn't stealing."

I made a whole video about [how I manage all my video content on my NAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VkY1vTpCJY). I run software called Jellyfin, and I've ripped _hundreds_ of movies and _thousands_ of TV episodes over the years. My family can enjoy every movie and TV show I've bought, now and forever.

But _most_ people don't do that. And even for crazies like me, it's getting harder. More and more TV series and movies are going stream-only.

Meaning the _only_ way to ever watch it is to subscribe to yet another broken and temporary streaming service.

You'd think as the years wore on, society's access to media would get easier and better.

But instead, backwards-thinking execs in Hollywood and the music industry keep backpedaling, making it _harder_ for you to actually watch the content they produce.

I mean, more and more of it is garbage anyway, but there are still compelling shows and movies out there. It's a shame they're committed to being so anti-consumer by killing off any semblance of ownership.

In my video about Jellyfin, I danced around the issue of piracy. Mostly because I know how pernicious the MPAA and RIAA are.

Well, you know what? I still don't officially endorse pirating content. But if there's literally _no other way_ to view the content you already paid for? Who am I to judge?

And cracking DRM? First of all, it's _laughable_ how bad DRM normally is. But second, DRM is the enabler of all the horrible, scummy business practices that lead to so much e-waste, _and_ to kids being disappointed in their Dad for not being able to play music that's been available digitally for years.

So if you crack DRM to truly own the things you already paid for? Yeah, I don't got a problem with that.

Forget spaceships flying to Mars, I just want my music.
