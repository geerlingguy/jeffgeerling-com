> **Update**: I was able to get everything to work—but I couldn't get the RX 6700 XT's drivers installed in Ubuntu. There are probably a few reasons for that... but it definitely wasn't as straightforward as I had hoped. I'll post an update soon.

Last year, in my work towards bringing up a graphics card on the Raspberry Pi, I was fortunate enough to acquire an AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT at near-retail price (thanks to a viewer who assisted my luck!).

This year, as part of a slightly-zany video [building a Raspberry Pi into a standard desktop PC](/blog/2022/building-desktop-pi-pc-axzezs-interceptor), I was able to gather enough parts to make up a halfway-decent gaming/creative PC centered around the RX 6700 XT, and instead of putting it together myself, I thought I'd share in the potential disaster in a live stream—tune in at 10 a.m. US Central time on March 3 (or watch below):

<div class="yt-embed">
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Obky7vN8aXY" frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div>

I may do a follow-up and/or post more thoughts about this PC build in another blog post, as it will be the first time installing Ubuntu's desktop OS on a PC in a number of years (last time I used a PC as a desktop—though as a secondary machine—I ran Fedora). I'll be running through some benchmarks and possibly trying out a game or two. And seeing how much faster it is building the Linux kernel compared to my Raspberry Pi 4 ;)
