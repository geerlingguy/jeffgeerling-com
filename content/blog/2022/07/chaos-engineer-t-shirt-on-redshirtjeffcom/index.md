Like my last new shirt ([It was DNS](/blog/2022/it-was-dns-t-shirt-on-redshirtjeffcom), I figured I'd mention [my latest shirt design](https://redshirtjeff.com/listing/rsj-chaos-engineer?product=46) here on the blog in case you're interested:

{{< figure src="./chaos-engineer-shirt.jpg" alt="Chaos Engineer shirt on RedShirtJeff.com" width="400" height="400" class="insert-image" >}}

As a parent of four, I thought it would be especially fitting on a onesie, therefore in addition to two 'normal' shirt options, <s>there's a version for your baby</s> (this version is out of print for now... let me know in the comments if you'd like to see it again!):

You can [buy the 'Chaos Engineer' T-shirt on RedShirtJeff.com](https://www.redshirtjeff.com/shop/p/chaos-engineer-shirt).
