In case you didn't know, the Raspberry Pi turns 10 today!

That's right—the Raspberry Pi model B (pictured above, front left) was launched on February 29th, 2012. And it sold out immediately.

That seems to have become a theme with every Pi model, but for anyone who _does_ have a Pi kicking around in a box somewhere—or if you're lucky enough to [find a Pi in stock](https://rpilocator.com)—check out my latest video, where I go through my top 10 Raspberry Pi projects (all of which I've built, and _most_ of which I'm still running today!):
