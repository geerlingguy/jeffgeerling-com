I received a couple BliKVM units recently, and since I don't have as much of a need (my only 'remote' PC is about 2' away from my desk...), I brought them to my Dad's radio station, and we set it up in their main on-air PC so operators could access the PC and fix problems at home, instead of driving in!

Check out our video on this board on the new [Geerling Engineering YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/GeerlingEngineering/featured):
