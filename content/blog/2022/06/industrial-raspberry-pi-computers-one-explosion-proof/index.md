In today's video, I highlighted industrial Raspberry Pi computers. Specifically, the [Lincoln-Binns CM4-Box Pro](https://lincolnbinns.com/shop/internet-of-things-iot/compute-module-4-enclosures.html), the [Onlogic Factor 201](https://www.onlogic.com/computers/industrial/fanless/factor-200/), and [fieldcloud's](https://fieldcloud.com) Milü-X Industrial IoT Gateway.

And I asked Lincoln-Binns, Onlogic, and fieldcloud what makes an 'Industrial' Pi any different than a Pi and an enclosure like you could buy from a normal Pi retailer.

After all, even accounting for [custom Compute Module 4 carrier boards](https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com/boards_cm), there are dozens of similar options for less than a hundred bucks. Why does the Factor 201 I reviewed cost over $500? And why is the Milü-X—which can't be bought standalone—so expensive that fieldcloud doesn't list the price?

The answer is _any_ industrial computer—whether Raspberry Pi-based or X86, or whatever—has to go through much more rigorous testing, and has to run in vastly different environments than your run of the mill hobby board you'd run in your home or office.

And like the board pictured above—a eurocard mount for Lincoln-Binns' board—they are often built to be mounted in unique configurations, whether DIN rail, VESA, standalone, or in something completely custom, like the Milü-X's enclosure, which is certified for use in highly explosive environments like oil refineries, flour mills, mines, and pharmaceutical plants:
