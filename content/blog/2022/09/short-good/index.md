I watched TheOdd1sOut's How to Find Inspiration[^1] and remembered the most important lesson I learned from my high school English teacher:

Short is good. _Short is hard_.

The teacher[^2] didn't exactly put it like that. But he harped on something _nobody else_ did: writing concisely.

Every week we would read a work of American literature. And every Friday we'd turn in a one-pager encapsulating our knowledge of the book. I was an odd duck for how much I enjoyed the game: no playing with margins or font sizes. I had to cram an entire book into one page, double-spaced, with 1" margins, a title line, and a byline.

I remember spending Thursday nights honing my text, usually down to around 500 words. We would get a slight bonus for conveying more with fewer words.

That's surprisingly difficult for teenagers conditioned to churn out a specific word count. TheOdd1sOut commiserates:

> I feel like the American school system has brainwashed kids into thinking that the best way to express ideas is through the form of a five paragraph essay.
>
> And most schools require essays to have a minimum word count! So we are now training the next generation into purposely writing long-winded and wordy thoughts that could've been shortened down a _sentence_!

I've found success on YouTube through my writing style. Like the [LockPickingLawyer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm9K6rby98W8JigLoZOh6FQ), I value my audience's time.

I spend more time _editing_ my scripts than writing them. Whittling at extraneous drivel so the video contains maximum relevance and minimal filler[^3].

From TheOdd1sOut:

> The first piece of advice that I can give that will immediately improve your scripts is:

> _Getting to the point._

Indeed.

[^2]: Hello, Dr. Chura!

[^3]: Sometimes I run out of time in script editing, but I always regret it. Every sentence I write carries a cost through recording, editing, and the dreaded YouTube 'audience retention' metric. If you can cut dead weight early in the process, the benefit is exponential.
