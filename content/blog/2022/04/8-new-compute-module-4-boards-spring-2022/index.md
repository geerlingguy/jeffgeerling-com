It's been a busy start to the year on my [Raspberry Pi PCIe Devices](https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com) website. Not only have we finally made some significant progress learning about the BCM2711's PCIe bus (both good and bad), I've also added a few _dozen_ new Raspberry Pi CM4-based boards to the site.

In my YouTube video today, I go through four of them in depth, showing how they're built and what they're used for.

The four projects I cover in depth are:

  1. Bigtreetech's [Raspberry Pad 5](https://www.biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-raspberry-pad-5)
  2. Seeed Studio's [reTerminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/ReTerminal-with-CM4-p-4904.html)
  3. Waveshare's [Dual Ethernet 5G/4G base board](https://www.waveshare.com/product/cm4-dual-eth-4g-5g-box.htm)
  4. Ab-log's [RPi4-RTC-PoE DIN rail computer](https://ab-log.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1895)

And there are some other projects I'm watching closely as they journey down the road towards production:

  - Kincony's [KC868 Home Automation Server](https://www.kincony.com/home-automation-local-server.html)
  - The [Pockit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3F9OtH2Xx4)
  - MNT Reform's [RCM4 Compute Adapter](https://www.mntmn.com/media/reform_md/2022-03-03-reform-march-update.html)
  - The [PSPi Portable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JORz7SodY0Y)

I will be diving deeper into the Waveshare Dual Ethernet 5G/4G base board later this year as I work on building a mobile OpenWRT router for 4G LTE backup Internet, to see how closely I can compete with a commercial product like a Cradlepoint for half the price.

See all these devices in action in this week's video, embedded below:
