This weekend, I'm down in Springfield, MO, photographing the <a href="http://stlyouth.org/steubenville">Steubenville St. Louis Mid-America</a> youth conference (which is on its second weekend—more than 6,000 teens participate in this event!).

I'll be posting my pictures in near-real-time to Flickr (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stlyouth/">on stlyouth's photostream</a> — here's a link to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stlyouth/collections/72157634705128015/">all the pictures from the weekend</a>), and I'll hopefully have time to do a writeup on the gear I'm using—two Nikon bodies (including a rented D7100!), two Eye-Fi cards, and a 4G hotspot.

Here are two of my favorite shots from the tonight (Eucharistic Adoration is always a highlight):

You can follow along the entire weekend on the <a href="http://live.stlyouth.org/">OYM's Live Blog</a>, or via any of the OYM's various social media accounts (listed in the right column of the live blog). Jennifer Brinker, of the St. Louis Review, has already written <a href="http://stlouisreview.com/article/2013-07-19/social-media-presence">a story about the use of social media during the conference</a> which is worth a read. She and photographer Sid Hastings will be working some stories throughout the weekend (it's always fun to shoot alongside a more seasoned photographer!).
