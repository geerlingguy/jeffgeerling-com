It seems the media has taken every opportunity to spin Pope Francis' words as being veiled criticisms of his predecessor's own words, <em>especially</em> when it comes to liturgical and theological topics. While it's great seeing the media show meager support at times, rather than destructive criticism for a Pope at every turn, it's misguided and not really that helpful.

All the press is saying is that what makes Catholicism <em>Catholic</em> (liturgy, ritual, priesthood, catechesis, etc.) is irrelevant, and we should worry more about the poor and such instead—and they're taking many translated quotes from Pope Francis out of context to support their theories. This horse has been beaten to death by many well-intentioned cafeteria Catholics throughout my lifetime, and I'm quite sick of it.

James over at the Forum has written about this a few times, and his most recent post, <a href="http://catholicpublius.blogspot.com/2013/07/criticism-of-benedict-in-rio.html">"Criticism" of Benedict in Rio?</a> is spot-on:

<blockquote>
Ever since Francis was elected, the media has been relentlessly billing him as the anti-Benedict. [...]

I can't agree that a problem dogging the Catholic Church over the past forty years has been "intellectualism" or "rigid formulas". If anything, we've traded in the intellect for the purely sentimental, even saccharine. For two generations and counting, Catholics have been reared in an anti-intellectual ethos, from schools to liturgy. Have you been to a typical Catholic parish recently? It's almost all touchy-feely: name tags, silly songs, hand-holding, Father Personality and his cringeworthy jokes, backslapping, high-fives, no substance, etc. It never ends. And having attended Catholics schools for most of my youth, I can't say that "intellectualism" was a cause for many of my peers leaving the Church (which many of them did). We simply weren't taught the essentials of the faith. Period.

Go read the <a href="http://catholicpublius.blogspot.com/2013/07/criticism-of-benedict-in-rio.html">full post</a>—every word rings true for faithful Catholics in my generation. From what I've seen, Catholic parishes in the U.S. have been anything <em>but</em> intellectual, clerical, etc. If anything, we need to go back to our liturgical and catechetical roots to find our faith and a true relationship with Jesus <em>before</em> we can presume to be of any assistance to the poor or others in need!
