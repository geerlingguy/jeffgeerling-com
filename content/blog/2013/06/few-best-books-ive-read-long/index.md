I recently noticed the video below on the official Star Wars YouTube channel, and I immediately popped over to Amazon.com to put <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345511468/?tag=mmjjg-20">The Making of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</a> into my wish list (it's set for release on October 1, 2013!).

I've read both of J.W. Rinzler's other existing <em>Making of Star Wars</em> books (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345494768/?tag=mmjjg-20">Episode IV</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345509617/?tag=mmjjg-20">Episode V</a>), and I thoroughly enjoyed both of them (read <a href="/review/miscellaneous/making-star-wars-empire">my review of The Making of The Empire Strikes Back here</a>). I can't imagine Episode VI's book being any worse!

Everyone who grew up watching Star Wars should have a read through these books. The stunning, full-color images alone are worth the $50—the incredible amount of information contained in the interviews, stories, and script notes make the books worth even more, in my opinion. It makes re-watching the movies an entirely new experience—<em>again</em>.
