I don't know yet whether I'll be able to attend this year's <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/">Catholic New Media Celebration</a>, which is being held on October 19, 2013 in Boston, MA. If I can't make it, it will be the first time since CNMC 2009 (San Antonio, TX — where I met <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/3666588647/">this guy</a>) that I'm not in attendance (and the first time since 2010 that I haven't presented at the conference!), but even so, I'll be watching from afar and praying for those who are able to attend and continue spreading the seeds of faith on the fertile (but rocky) ground of the Internet!

If you're a Catholic, and you're involved with evangelization, marketing, blogging, podcasting, or spreading the faith in any way, this is a great conference. <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/event-registration/">Early-bird registration</a> is only $99, and even if you can't attend physically, they offer a virtual ticket for the same price (which gets you all the audio and slides from the event, along with some other bonuses).
