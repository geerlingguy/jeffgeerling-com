Pope Francis released his Apostolic Exhortation, <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium_en.html">Evangelii Gaudium</a> (<em>Joy of the Gospel</em>), today.

I'm having a quick read through it, but as with all other Papal writings, I'm pretty sure it requires a deeper reading sometime when I have a quiet period of time to reflect on it.

There's already some chatter about certain statements the Pope makes in this Exhortation, and many others can summarize and scrutinize much better than I.

In other news, I found out about this release pretty soon after it was published, since I've been beta-testing the <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/about/mobile-app">Catholic News Live mobile app</a> for iOS 7... it will be released shortly! (More to come...).
