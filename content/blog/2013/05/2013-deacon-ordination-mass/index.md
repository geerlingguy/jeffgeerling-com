This year's Transitional Deacon Ordination Mass took place last Saturday, May 4 (May the 4th be with you! <em>And with your spirit.</em>).

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/8716400580/" title="2013 Deacon Ordination 163 by geerlingguy, on Flickr">{{< figure src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7431/8716400580_a81c75566d_z.jpg" alt="2013 Deacon Ordination 163" width="564" height="640" >}}</a></p>

I was privileged to be able to take photos for this year's transitional deacons, even more so since I will be unable to attend the Priesthood Ordination Mass this year (due to my attendance at DrupalCon Portland), and was happy to see many of my seminarian friends become deacons—one step closer to their journey towards the priesthood.
