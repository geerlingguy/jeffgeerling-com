In 2011, I left my job as the web developer for the Archdiocese of St. Louis to <a href="/blog/2011/a-new-job">join Flocknote</a>, and help build Flocknote into a great communications tool for churches, ministries, teams and organizations.

I've worked with some <a href="http://www.flocknote.com/team">great people</a> at Flocknote (hi Matt, Barrett, Kait, Derek, LCM staff et all!), and have enjoyed the challenge of building a major web application on top of Drupal 7. Flocknote was built back when Drupal 7 was in the 7.1 and 7.2 stages (when many, many modules had not yet been ported from Drupal 6, and I found and patched core bugs on a daily basis!), and I was able to learn much about the craft of programming, server administration, project management, and Drupal working on <a href="http://www.flocknote.com/">Flocknote</a>, an <a href="http://www.flocknote.com/mobile">iPhone App</a>, and an <a href="http://www.flocknote.com/help/api">API</a>, among hundreds of other little things.

Beginning next month (almost exactly two years since my start date at Flocknote), I'll be working with <a href="http://www.mercy.net/">Mercy</a>, the sixth largest Catholic health care system in the US (more <a href="http://www.mercy.net/about">about Mercy</a>). I'm excited to begin working in this new environment with a new team, and will continue developing with Drupal both in the new job and in my free time (with projects like my <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/services/hosted-solr-search">hosted Apache Solr search</a> and <a href="https://servercheck.in/">Server Check.in</a>, as well as my other sites and organizations I help with).

If you or someone you know might be interested in the main web developer position at Flocknote, please see the <a href="http://www.flocknote.com/jobs#developer">Web Developer job posting on Flocknote</a> and apply today!
