This is old news to some, but my wife and I are expecting a <strong>baby</strong> early in this new year. Please say a prayer that everything goes well! (No, we don't know the gender; and no, we will not be sharing pictures or other info publicly at this time, <a href="http://readwrite.com/2010/01/09/facebooks_zuckerberg_says_the_age_of_privacy_is_ov">Mr. Zuckerberg's thoughts on privacy</a> notwithstanding!)

On another note, I have at least five large bits of writing that I'm still working on—a photography book, a few articles and tutorials for this site, and some other things. Hopefully I'll be able to find some time to get thoughts on <del>paper</del>screen soon!

For now, check out some of these popular bits from 2012 you may have missed:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/articles/photography/iphone-4-ipad-external-mic-audio-input">iPhone/iPad external microphones</a> (article is still up-to-date after a few years and three iPhones later... by far the most popular article on this site)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2012/catholic-new-media-conference-cnmc">CNMC 2012 Wrap-up</a> (another year, another Catholic New Media Conference)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2012/iphone-5-review-and-external">iPhone 5 Review and External Microphone Comparison</a> (seems like a trend...)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2012/crestwood-mall-ghost-town">Crestwood Mall - Ghost Town</a> (another dead mall in St. Louis)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2012/my-workstation-2012-edition">My Workstation - 2012 Edition</a> (I have more posts about my work area coming!)</li>
</ul>

In addition to helping <a href="http://www.flocknote.com/">Flocknote</a> grow by leaps and bounds this past year, I've launched <a href="https://servercheck.in/">Server Check.in</a>, a website monitoring service, moved into a new home (giving me incentive to write about things like <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/articles/miscellaneous/2012/tips-and-tools-new-homeowners">Tips and Tools for New Homeowners<a/>), and done a ton of <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> development. Not a bad year!
