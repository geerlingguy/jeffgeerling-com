I noticed this video from the Center for Reproductive Rights on YouTube today, after seeing it posted by a few different people on Facebook and Google+:

<em>What were they thinking?</em>

There are so many things wrong with this video, it's hard to pick just a few to comment on:

<ul>
<li>A <strong>black</strong> man. Seriously? Do they realize that <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/black-abortions-necessary-health-care-policy-or-genocide-723325">abortions are performed disproportionately on the black population</a>, and that those who dismiss this statistic's negative interpretation as evangelical fanaticism say it's a good thing because it <em>helps black people in their struggle to overcome poverty and poor health care</em>?</li>
<li>A black <strong>man</strong>. Okay, so the video's already able to be construed as having some sort of racial overtones. As if that's bad enough, a man celebrating a "women's right to abortion" is about the most sexist and anti-feminine thing I can think of. The man is rightly happy (and strangely turned on—can you say <em>creeper</em>?) in the video because of the fact that he can have sex without consequences, with any woman he chooses, consequences-be-darned, because he knows women feel the pressure to use birth control—and when that fails, have abortions.</li>
<li>A black man <strong>drinking</strong>. Is the man drinking because he knows there are <a href="http://alcoholism.about.com/library/weekly/aa030107a.htm">higher risks of substance abuse for women who have abortions</a>? Is he drinking as an <em>in your face</em> to the heroic women who choose to carry a baby to term, but sacrificially forego drinking and modify their diets to help their babies remain healthy?</li>
</ul>

It's like the Center for Reproductive Rights is run by sexist, racist white men! Again: <em>what were they thinking?</em> I'd be surprised if the video is <em>not</em> pulled offline at some point. It's already at 2.5k dislikes (with just 114 likes), and all the top comments are negative.
