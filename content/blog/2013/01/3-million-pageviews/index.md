Wow. Just glanced at stats for 2008-now on jeffgeerling.com, and it looks like I've passed <strong>3,000,000 page views</strong>, with more than 1.6 million unique visitors (I didn't keep stats from 2004-2008, so I don't have data for that time).

Thanks for all your visits, and for helping me improve this site through your feedback! I've received over 1,500 comments and 1,000 emails over the course of 800 <a href="/blog">blog posts</a>, 60 <a href="/articles">articles</a>, 31 <a href="/reviews">reviews</a>, and 1,100 <a href="/photo-galleries">photos</a> posted to this site. I've written over 40,000 words in the posts on this site (not yet enough for a novel), and I've written similar amounts for sites like <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/">Open Source Catholic</a> and <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/">Midwestern Mac</a>.

One of my greatest dilemmas is whether to consolidate sites like those into this site, or to try to keep Life is a Prayer more about personal things, marriage, family life, etc. Here's to another 40,000 words figuring it out!
