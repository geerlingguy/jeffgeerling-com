<blockquote class="tldr"><strong>tl;dr</strong>: For the price, these cans can't be beat. Durable, simple, and powerful.</blockquote>

In 2005, I bought a pair of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00007E7C8/?tag=mmjjg-20">Audio Technica ATR-M30 headphones</a>. After helping a band record an album (<a href="http://www.priestieboyz.com/music.html">Lost in Ecstasy, by the Priestie Boyz</a>), three trips to Europe, and hundreds of hours of listening enjoyment at home, nothing except the pads on these headphones has needed replacement (and those are cheap and simple to replace—I bought a set of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007BQM2ZC/?tag=mmjjg-20">replacement pads for $10</a>).

These headphones sound very good (compared to a few of the other $99-$199 headphones I've used), and have proven quite durable. They've survived extremely high sound levels (turning the knob on our headphone amp to 10—which is loud enough that people can hear it indoors about 200 ft. away!), multiple drops (one time a band member tore them off his head and threw them on the floor), and lots of transport (usually squished between my computer and some books in my backpack).

They can make my ears uncomfortable after an hour's work, but that's usually about the time I realize I should get out of my chair and take a short break. They're a little heavy for my liking, and can favor the low-end a little too much sometimes, but I'll accept these shortcomings for the bargain price on this pair of headphones.

The best thing? These headphones are now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00007E7C8/?tag=mmjjg-20">less than $50 on Amazon</a>. When I bought my pair in 2006, these headphones were $50. Now they're $40. You could definitely do worse!

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00007E7C8/?tag=mmjjg-20">Buy the Audio Technica ATH-M30 headphones on Amazon for <span itemprop="price">$39</span></a>.
