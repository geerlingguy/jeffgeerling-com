In some ways, viewing this VR image (zoom in to see incredible detail) is better than visiting in person, because you don't have to listen to constant shushing and be packed in a small space with more than a hundred other people!

The picture above was adjusted in Photoshop after a screen grab, and shows Michaelangelo's famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Judgment_(Michelangelo)"><em>The Last Judgement</em></a>.

The best part? It also works on the iPad. Check it out here: <a href="http://www.vatican.va/various/cappelle/sistina_vr/index.html">Virtual tour of the Sistine Chapel</a>.
