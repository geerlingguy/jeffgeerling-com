I've gotten this question enough times via email that I thought I'd create a quick blog post mentioning what I think is a good deal for a video camera setup for recording short videos, ideally with one person speaking.

In such a situation, since you probably won't see a major difference in picture quality in anything under $500, I'd skimp a little on the camera itself and just make sure the video camera you buy has an external microphone input, then buy a microphone like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HJ9PTO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002HJ9PTO&linkCode=as2&tag=mmjjg-20">Audio-Technica ATR-3350</a> to clip onto the person being recorded.

<strong>A microphone goes a long way towards making quality video</strong>—many people think the camera's the most important part of a video recording setup, but it really isn't (unless you're doing a top-notch production!). That's how I can use the tiny iPhone camera as my primary video camera and record good videos, since the <a href="/articles/photography/iphone-4-ipad-external-mic-audio-input">iPhone accepts external microphones</a> so easily.

<h2>The camera</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./canon-vixia-camera.jpg" alt="Canon VIXIA HD Camcorder" width="350" height="238" class="blog-image" >}}</p>

I'd buy a Canon VIXIA camera, as long as it has an external microphone input. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00322ON8S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00322ON8S&linkCode=as2&tag=mmjjg-20">Canon VIXIA HF R100 is only $179 on Amazon</a>, and it records great video and has a microphone and headphone jack.

<h2>The microphone</h2>

As stated earlier, using an external microphone (instead of the cheap, junky built-in microphone) will dramatically improve the overall quality of your recordings. I recommend two different microphones:

<ul>
<li><strong>For one-person recordings</strong>: Buy a lavaliere microphone. If you'll be less than 10' from the camera, buy an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HJ9PTO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002HJ9PTO&linkCode=as2&tag=mmjjg-20">Audio-Technica ATR-3350 for $20</a>. If you'll be further away, a good wireless lavaliere is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006I523/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00006I523&linkCode=as2&tag=mmjjg-20">Audio Technica Pro88W-R35 for $130</a> (see my <a href="/review/audio-and-video/review-audio-technica-pro88w">review</a>).</li>
<li><strong>For multiple people or environmental recordings</strong>: Buy a shotgun microphone. My favorite is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007U9SOC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0007U9SOC&linkCode=as2&tag=mmjjg-20">Rode VideoMic for $150</a>, but you could get by with a cheaper option.</li>
</ul>
