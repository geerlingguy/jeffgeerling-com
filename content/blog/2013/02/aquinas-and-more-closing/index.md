<a href="http://www.aquinasandmore.com/">Aquinas and More</a>, a great Catholic store that had probably the best selection of Catholic goods available online, seems to be going out of business soon. This is unfortunate, because that means I'll have to go to Catholic <del>Ripoff</del> Supply more often (and their website needs major improvement). Ah well.

For now until they run out of inventory, they're having a <a href="http://www.aquinasandmore.com/">20% off sale</a> on almost everything.
