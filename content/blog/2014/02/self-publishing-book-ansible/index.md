I've published the first portion of a book I've been writing, <a href="https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops">Ansible for DevOps</a>. This is my first-ever book, and I've written a little about the process of writing on Server Check.in's blog: <a href="https://servercheck.in/blog/self-publishing-my-first-technical-book-leanpub">Self-publishing my first technical book on LeanPub</a>.

I'm excited about the early feedback I've already received—and I haven't even finished writing half the book! I'm hoping to finish the first complete draft of the book (and continue publishing it in stages on LeanPub) by summer 2014.
