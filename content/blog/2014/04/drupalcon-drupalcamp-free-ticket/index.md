This week, the DrupalCon Austin sessions <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/news/drupalcon-austin-sessions-are-up">have been posted</a>, and I'm thrilled to have one of my session submissions (in the DevOps track) selected: <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/devops-humans-ansible-drupal-deployment-victory">DevOps for Humans: Ansible for Drupal Deployment Victory!</a>.

The session will go over how Ansible can be used to realize faster, easier, and more successful Drupal deployments, as well as Ansible's ability to make sure that every environment is 'like production', so you don't ever have surprises when you deploy code to its final destination.

If you're interested in building a DevOps culture for your company or consultancy, or if you're already using tools like Puppet or Chef, and want to see what Ansible might offer (YAML and Twig-like template syntax (Jinja2), for starters—just like Drupal 8!), please join me for the session at DrupalCon. The session will cover some of the material I'm writing about in my book-in-progress, <a href="https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops">Ansible for DevOps</a>.

<h2>DrupalCamp St. Louis 2014</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://2014.drupalstl.org/">{{< figure src="./drupalcamp-2014-stl-logo.png" alt="DrupalCamp 2014 St. Louis Logo" width="300" height="101" >}}</a></p>

I'll also be presenting a couple sessions at <a href="https://2014.drupalstl.org/">DrupalCamp St. Louis</a>, which is coming up on April 26. I'll first speak a bit about Drupal 8 (mostly a show-and-tell), then I'll talk about Drupal's role in building <a href="https://servercheck.in/">Server Check.in</a> with Drupal and Node.js.

If you live in or around the St. Louis metro area (or even anywhere near us in the midwest), come join us for a great day-long event; registration gets you a free lunch, shirt, and after-party, plus great sessions and a keynote by Palantiri <a href="http://palantir.net/about/team/brad-nowak">Brad Nowak</a>.

<h2>A free ticket to DrupalCon Austin!</h2>

Since I've already acquired my ticket for this year's DrupalCon prior to my session being selected (thanks to <a href="http://www.mercy.net/">Mercy</a>!), I am able to give a free DrupalCon ticket to someone else. I'd like to give the ticket to someone who wouldn't normally be able to attend DrupalCon (e.g. a student or someone who can't get work to pay for the price of admission). Please tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/geerlingguy">@geerlingguy</a> and let me know if you're interested. I'll pick someone at random and get you set up with a free ticket!
