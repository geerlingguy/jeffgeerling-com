My sister's family just started a new St. Louis-area business, <a href="http://theeasychicken.com/">The Easy Chicken</a>, providing resources to those interested in raising chickens in an urban or suburban environment.

There are some potentially difficult and time-consuming aspects to keeping chickens in an urban environment: acquiring chickens, seeking permits or licenses from particular municipalities, finding a source for feed, coops, and other materials, and finding reliable information about keeping chickens healthy. The Easy Chicken's tagline is <em>Backyard eggs made easy</em>, and they have the <em>easy</em> part nailed down, as they'll help anyone through all the different steps, and provide all the necessary supplies (including guaranteed-to-lay hens!).

Check out <a href="http://theeasychicken.com/">The Easy Chicken's website</a> for much more information, and please pass along the link to anyone you know who might be interested in raising chickens and having some fresh eggs and fun, finely-feathered pets!
