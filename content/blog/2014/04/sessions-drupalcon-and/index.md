I mentioned this elsewhere (see: <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/drupalcon-drupalcamp-free-ticket">DrupalCon and DrupalCamp news</a>), but I'll post here as well; I'm going to be speaking at both DrupalCon Austin and DrupalCamp St. Louis this year!

I've submitted a few sessions to DrupalCon Austin in the past, mostly surrounding the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/honeypot">Honeypot</a> module for Drupal, but this year, a session I submitted in the DevOps track was chosen: <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/devops-humans-ansible-drupal-deployment-victory.html">DevOps for Humans: Ansible for Drupal Deployment Victory!</a>. I figured since I'm <a href="http://ansiblefordevops.com/">writing a book on Ansible</a>, and I use Ansible to provision servers and do all the deployments for my Drupal sites, I might as well show other Drupal developers how easy it is to get started and how much you can do with Ansible!

I'll also be delivering two sessions at <a href="https://2014.drupalstl.org/">DrupalCamp St. Louis 2014</a>, on April 26 in Clayton, MO (just outside of the city of St. Louis); one on Drupal 8 (a show-and-tell), and one on <a href="https://servercheck.in/">Server Check.in</a> (a case study).

If you're a Drupalist, I hope to see you at one of these events!
