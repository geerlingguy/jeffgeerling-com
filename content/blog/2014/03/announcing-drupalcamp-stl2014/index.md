St. Louis is getting ready for its first-ever DrupalCamp! On April 26, 2014, <a href="https://2014.drupalstl.org/">DrupalCamp St. Louis</a> will open up with a keynote by Brad Nowak, a Business Development Manager at Palantir. The Camp will have sessions covering a variety of topics, like Drupal 8 and how your business can benefit from Drupal's flexibility. It will be held at Washington University's West Campus in Clayton, MO, just a few blocks from a MetroLink station and only a few minutes away from Downtown St. Louis!

<a href="https://2014.drupalstl.org/register">Online registration</a> is open already, and for the next couple of weeks, earlybird registration is only $15! For that tiny fee you get:

<ul>
<li>A free lunch from Lywelyns</li>
<li>An snazzy t-shirt</li>
<li>A full day's worth of Drupal learning from some great Drupal users and developers in St. Louis and the midwest</li>
<li>A fun after party paid for by our excellent sponsors</li>
</ul>

Space is limited, so register early to guarantee a spot at the first DrupalCamp in the region!

Also, if you're interested in speaking at the Camp, please submit your session; we'd love to hear about sites you've built, new things in Drupal, business uses of Drupal, project management, site building, etc.!
