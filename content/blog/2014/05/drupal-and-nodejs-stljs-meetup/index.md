<a href="http://www.meetup.com/STL-JS-meetup/">{{< figure src="./stljs-logo.jpg" alt="STL.JS Meetup Logo" width="180" height="180" >}}</a>I'll be presenting <a href="http://www.meetup.com/STL-JS-meetup/events/151436472/">Node.js and Drupal — Working Together</a> at the STL.JS meetup this Thursday, May 15, at <a href="http://theablefew.com/">The Able Few</a> in St. Louis.

In the presentation, I'll basically be covering how <a href="https://servercheck.in/">Server Check.in</a> uses Drupal and Node.js to deliver a simple, fast, and stable server monitoring service. During the course of the presentation, I'll touch on why and how Server Check.in was built, how Ansible is used to maintain the infrastructure, and the effectiveness of lightweight marketing, blogging, and 'low end box' servers.

Join me and many JS developers in St. Louis on May 15, and after the presentation, we'll hack on some of the things mentioned in the presentation!

I'm also hard at work on my <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/devops-humans-ansible-drupal-deployment-victory">DevOps for Humans: Ansible for Drupal Deployment Victory!</a> presentation, which I'll be giving at DrupalCon Austin 2014. I hope to see you there! (Slides from both presentations will be posted online after the respective events).
