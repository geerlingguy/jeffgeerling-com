Between <a href="https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops">writing a book on Ansible</a>, <a href="https://www.desmet.org/high-school-volleyball.html">coaching volleyball at De Smet</a>, preparing presentations for <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/drupal-and-nodejs-stljs-meetup">STL.JS</a> and <a href="https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/devops-humans-ansible-drupal-deployment-victory">DrupalCon</a>, and—lest I forget the most important responsibility of all—being a loving father and husband (see photo below!), I haven't had more than a minute to spare for writing for this blog, or processing some of the fun photos I've taken of ducks, deer, a fox, or feral cats running around our house!

Even with the bustle, I feel more calm now than I have for a while. Last year, at this time, I was in the hospital suffering from a terrible bout of mono (which attacked me while my immune system was being suppressed by one of my Crohn's-related drugs!). That experience gives me perspective, and I try to remember the thoughts that were going through my head the night I was in the ICU, asking for my pastor to anoint me, just in case...

In the midst of the hustle and bustle of your life, remember your purpose, your dignity, and that <em>you</em> are in control of your stress, your worries, and your fears. Keep calm and carry on!
