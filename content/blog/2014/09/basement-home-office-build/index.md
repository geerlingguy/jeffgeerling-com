Sorry for the radio silence over the past couple months—I've been quite busy! In addition to finishing up my responsibilities at my old job (I'm going to start my <a href="/blog/2014/new-job-2014-edition">new job at Acquia</a> in just a week!), I've had a bunch of crazy, fun, and interesting things happen lately:

<ul>
<li>My new <strong>baby girl</strong> was born a little over a week ago—and that makes two... a 20-month old and a 1.5-week old.</li>
<li>Said 20-month old boy grew up in the two days we went to the hospital for the birth of our little girl. When did he get so big?!</li>
<li>I made a little progress on my book, <a href="https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops">Ansible for DevOps</a>, and the book is inching towards 1,000 readers pre-publication... which boggles my mind!</li>
<li>I built a home office and am getting prepared for another stint of working remote from the home (or wherever else is convenient and conducive to great work!).</li>
</ul>

<em>Completed framing for the new office. My spirits were soaring, but drywalling would soon take its toll and teach me that some things are best left to the pros. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/wc7wD">See full album of images &raquo;</a></em></p>

The home office build took a little over a month (for the major construction portion—I'll be rearranging for weeks!), and was an awesome experience. I took a ton of pictures and made many, many notes in <a href="http://imgur.com/a/wc7wD">an album I posted to Imgur</a>, and discussed in a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/2fpzrt/basement_home_office/">thread on Reddit</a> that blew up with over 2,000 upvotes!

I just wanted to mention the home office on my blog, since from time to time I take the chance to share some of the things I learn about building things, and I always like hearing from others ways I could've changed the process, tools, or final product to make it better. Since I'll likely be doing some more work in the basement in the next 20-40 years, I tried to learn as many lessons as I could from this first 12' x 12' project. Like "never ever ever finish drywall again."

The new baby has made life a little hectic, especially with a toddler, but I've heard going from 1 to 2 kids is the hardest—after that they start getting easier. I hope!
