In 2008, I <a href="/blog/2008/blogging-stlyouthorg-new-job">started working for the Archdiocese of St. Louis</a>, my first job where I ended up working on Drupal sites practically full-time (my first Drupal experience was on 4.x in 2005). I also started <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/">Midwestern Mac, LLC</a> in 2008, and from that time to now have built two SaaS services (<a href="http://hostedapachesolr.com/">Hosted Apache Solr</a> and <a href="https://servercheck.in/">Server Check.in</a>), and over 100 other Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 sites, along with a few mobile apps and a Mac app (<a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/quick-resizer">Quick Resizer</a>).

In 2011, I <a href="/blog/2011/a-new-job">moved on to Flocknote</a>, and learned a lot building a Drupal-based communications platform used by more than half a million people. This was also a full-time remote job, and I worked with a small but very strong team from Texas, Missouri, Florida, and Tennessee.

In 2013, I <a href="/blog/2013/new-job-2013-edition">went to Mercy</a> and worked on a major intranet migration (Drupal 6 to Drupal 7) and <a href="http://www.mercy.net/">Mercy.net</a>, the hospital system's patient-facing site, which runs on Drupal 7.

I am proud to have worked with all the individuals and companies these past few years, and am indebted to all of them for the support and professional development they've offered—each in a unique way. Throughout my work, I have had the good fortune to be able to learn other languages, tools, and techniques, even to the point of writing a <a href="https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops">book on Ansible</a>! I have also become a husband and father, and been able to do some great things in my Church, my community, and the Drupal community.

This year, I'm moving to <a href="http://www.acquia.com/">Acquia</a>! Acquia is one of the largest Drupal service providers, and I'll be working in the Professional Services group as a Technical Architect. In this new role, I'll be able to help even more organizations do amazing things with Drupal. I've only been to Acquia's Boston HQ once, but I already feel like a part of the team, as I've been in numerous Hangouts and chats (I'll be working remotely from St. Louis—new home-office-building project, yay!).

To all my co-workers at Mercy: thanks for the great time and fun projects we've worked on together. Keep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkTb7Pe2MtY">fighting for the users</a>! To my new co-workers at Acquia: I'm excited to join you guys, and look forward to seeing you starting October 6!
