<a href="/blog/2012/ethics-media-use-catholics-are">I feel like a broken record</a>... yet again, I was perusing the Internet (this time, Twitter), and then I noticed an illustration—a very familiar one—of the Roman collar (the white collar worn by priests):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>A great peace always came over me when I saw the Roman Collar, a rep of the high priest, Jesus Christ, was present <a href="http://t.co/9qH5VghciI">pic.twitter.com/9qH5VghciI</a></p>&mdash; Chris Boutin (@Boutleg) <a href="https://twitter.com/Boutleg/statuses/478032609336123392">June 15, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<a href="https://twitter.com/Boutleg">@Boutleg</a> didn't create the graphic; it looks like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CatholicMemebase/posts/206165549533195">uCatholic originally posted the graphic on Facebook</a>, where it was shared and reshared thousands of times, and liked (through that network of shares) many thousands of times.

Regardless, that graphic is the logo of the <a href="http://www.priestieboyz.com/">Priestie Boyz, and was lifted directly off the home page:

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.priestieboyz.com/">{{< figure src="./priestie-boyz-website.png" alt="Priestie Boyz home page" width="400" height="294" class="blog-image" >}}</a></p>

As I've stated in <a href="/blog/2012/ethics-media-use-catholics-are">my previous post</a> on this topic, <strong>Catholics are NOT excused from licensing or copyright law</strong>. <em>Besides</em> the fact that I would've immediately given permission for the image's use if a tag were added to the graphic attributing the source, I spent a lot of time working on that graphic, getting the curves just right, taking a bunch of different photos to get a good angle to distinctly show the collar, and a bit of money on Adobe Illustrator, which was used to create the vector artwork.

Please, please, <em>please</em> attribute sources (at a minimum), and ask image and photo owners for permission before spreading them around, especially on social media, where proper attribution is a very tricky business!
