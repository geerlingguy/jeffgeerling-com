Yours truly, sitting down on the job. Image from the <a href="http://stlouisreview.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/Souls-and-Goals/G0000MdtSjhjSS.s/I0000a938hOTCCkE">St. Louis Review</a>.</p>

It's almost time again for what is now an annual tradition—the 'Souls and Goals' soccer match in St. Louis, where the seminary soccer team will play against a team of 'clergy and company'; last year's match was a close game until late in the second half, when the Kenrick-Glennon Seminary Lions took a 2-0 lead and with it, the cup.

The game will be held at <strong>St. Dominic High School</strong> on <strong>Thursday, November 6</strong>, with Evening Prayer at 6 p.m. and the game starting at <strong>7 p.m</strong>. The game is free to anyone, and concessions will be available. For more info, check out <a href="http://soulsandgoals.org/">Souls and Goals.org</a>.

I'll be playing in goal again this year (as part of the 'and Company' on the Clergy side), wearing my Vatican-yellow jersey! Someday those priests will get a new goalie... but until that time I'm happy to get a little extra exercise and block some shots!
