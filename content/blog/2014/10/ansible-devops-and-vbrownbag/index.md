In the middle of preparations for next month's <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2014/souls-and-goals-2014-soccer">Souls & Goals</a> soccer match, I've also been very busy with Ansible-related activities.

I'm still making progress in writing <a href="https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops">Ansible for DevOps</a> (over 45,000 words, and over 900 people have already bought the book on LeanPub!), and I've been invited by the folks at Professional VMWare to present in their <a href="https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops">#vBrownBag DevOps Series</a>! I'll be talking about Ansible for an hour or so, and I'll be sure to post the link to the presentation after it's over.

You can join the presentation live (starts at 7:30 p.m. CST tonight, October 29) by registering at http://professionalvmware.com/brownbags/.

<strong>Update</strong>: You can now view the presentation and slides on ProfessionalVMWare.com: <a href="http://professionalvmware.com/2014/11/vbrownbag-devops-follow-up-learning-ansible-with-jeff-geerling-geerlingguy/">#vBrownBag DevOps Follow-Up Learning Ansible with Jeff Geerling (@geerlingguy)</a>.
