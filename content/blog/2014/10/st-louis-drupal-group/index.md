Now that Drupal 8.0.0-beta1 is out, and the headless Drupal craze is in full-swing, the Drupal St. Louis meetup this month will focus on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/drupalstl/events/210909552/">using Drupal 8 with AngularJS</a> to build a demo pizza ordering app. (The meetup is on Thurs. Oct. 23, starting at 6:30 p.m.; see even more info in this <a href="http://zerotodrupal.com/content/headless-drupal-angularjs-hackathon-st-louis">Zero to Drupal</a> post).

We'll be hacking away and seeing how far we can get, and hopefully we'll be able to leave with at least an MVP-quality product! I'll be at the event, mostly helping people get a Drupal 8 development environment up and running. For some, this alone will hopefully be a huge help, and maybe motivation to adopt Drupal 8 more quickly!

If you're in or around the St. Louis area, consider joining us; especially if you would like to learn something about either Drupal 8 or AngularJS!

P.S. To those who have been emailing: the rest of the Apache Solr search series is coming, it's just been postponed while I've started a new job at Acquia, and had a new baby!
