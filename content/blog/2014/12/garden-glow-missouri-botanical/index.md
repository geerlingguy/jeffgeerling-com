The <a href="http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/things-to-do/events/signature-events/garden-glow.aspx">Garden Glow</a> at the Missouri Botanical Garden is in its second year, and it seems to already be a 'thing to do' in St. Louis over the wintry holiday season.

<em>Nikon D7000, 17-55mm @ 55mm, ISO 800, f/2.8, 1/60</em></p>

I'd rank it almost equal to the great light displays at <a href="http://snows.org/events/way-of-lights/">Our Lady of Snows Shrine</a>, <a href="http://www.stlouisco.com/parksandrecreation/thingstodo/winterwonderland">Tilles Park</a>, and the <a href="http://www.stlzoo.org/events/calendarofevents/wildlights/">St. Louis Zoo</a>. Along a large portion of the Garden's paths, various light displays take you around some of this historic sites and buildings inside the Garden, and while parts are a bit 'touristy' feeling, the event is nice if the weather cooperates.

I highly recommend going if the temperature is above freezing (unlike last year, when it was like 10°F below!).
