Today I posted the [first episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1yaenrGF1o) of a new series on the [Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/).

{{< figure src="./raspberry-pi-hq-camera.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi HQ Camera with Tamron 8mm C-mount lens" width="600" height="432" class="insert-image" >}}

I plan on releasing a number of videos in the series covering how to use the HQ camera in various settings, like for astrophotography, nature photography and video, as a webcam or for streaming, for time-lapse photography, and for general photography.

I'll be updating this post with all the videos as I publish them:

# Episode 1 - Intro to Raspberry Pi HQ Camera

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1yaenrGF1o" frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Summary: The HQ Camera is a great improvement over the older Camera Module v2, for less than twice the price. It can be used for video or photography, and with the right technique and lenses, you can get very good quality images.

# Episode 2 - TBD

Coming soon!
