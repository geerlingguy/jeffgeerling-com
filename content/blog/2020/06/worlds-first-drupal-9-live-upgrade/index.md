> **Update**: The upgrade was a success! The site is now on Drupal 9.0.0, yay!

I'm planning on upgrading my [www.pidramble.com](https://www.pidramble.com) website from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 LIVE on my YouTube channel today, in honor of the [#D9Launch](https://twitter.com/hashtag/d9launch) today!

The site is currently running on a single Raspberry Pi on my desk in my basement... so this would not only be the world's first _live_ Drupal 9 upgrade, it may possibly be the first-ever Drupal 9 site running on a Raspberry Pi!

Fingers crossed, I hope Drupal 9.0.0 will be ready to go by 5:00 p.m. US Eastern time (today, June 3rd)—if so, the stream will begin at that time, and I've embedded it below:

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nLoJ2L0AzDY" frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

For more information about Drupal 9, see the [Drupal.org Drupal 9 About page](https://www.drupal.org/about/9).
