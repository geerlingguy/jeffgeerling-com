Earlier today, I presented a session at [AnsibleFest 2020](https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest) titled 'Continuous Testing with Molecule, Ansible, and GitHub Actions'. I also pre-recorded the session so I could share it [on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93urFkaJQ44), and for your convenience, the video is embedded below:

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/93urFkaJQ44" frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The presentation uses an example and explanation from Chapter 13 in my book, [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com).

Slides from the session are also [available on SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/geerlingguy/continuous-testing-with-molecule-ansible-and-github-actions).
