Like many of you, my life has changed because of open source software. Drupal, in particular, is the first open source project I became deeply involved in, and my income from Drupal work has supported my family for years.

I've attended local Drupal Camps, many DrupalCons, and even worked for a few great Drupal companies. The [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association) has been a major part of sustaining the Drupal community for many years, and due to COVID-19, [they're struggling financially this year](https://www.drupal.org/association/drupal-cares-challenge).

They rely heavily on DrupalCon revenue, and they use those funds to maintain and grow drupal.org, market Drupal, and support community events.

Unlike many other open source projects, Drupal is a community-first project. There's no one company that 'owns' Drupal, and so if the Drupal Association fails, there will be a lot of damage to the project.

Until the end of April, Dries Buytaert and his wife Vanessa have [pledged](https://dri.es/pledging-100000-usd-to-support-the-drupal-association) to match every donation made to the Drupal Association, up to $100,000.

> **Update 04/21**: Now a coalition of Drupal business will _also_ match all contributions this month, meaning every like will be worth **$3**!

For every like on the YouTube video above (you need to visit the video on YouTube directly or in the mobile app to click 'like'), I will donate $1 through my service [Hosted Apache Solr](https://hostedapachesolr.com). Those donations will be matched by Dries and Vanessa to double the impact, then matched by the coalition of Drupal businesses to triple the impact.

I don't think I'll get anywhere near this many likes, but I have to put a ceiling of $1,000 on my donation for financial reasons. But I would like to donate as much as possible, so please click like on the video—every person who does so just donated <s>2</s> 3 dollars!

You can also support the Drupal Association directly—follow this link: [Donate to the Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association/donate).

If you usually watch sports and want something to fill that void, I'm also doing a [live Drupal 7 to 8 migration series](/blog/2020/migrating-jeffgeerlingcom-drupal-7-drupal-8-how-video-series) on my YouTube channel; you can see upcoming streams by [subscribing to the channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling). I hope you are well and please support those who are less fortunate if you can!
