Friend and former colleague [Chris Urban](https://twitter.com/_urban_) and I will be presenting the results of the [2020 Drupal Local Development Survey](/blog/2020/2020-drupal-local-development-survey) at CMS Philly—which is now a virtual event—on May 1st. You can find more information about the session here: [2020 Developer Tool Survey Results](https://cmsphilly.org/talks/2020-developer-tool-survey-results). I'll also be posting the survey results on this blog soon after.

Chris also coaxed me into talking about my [ongoing Drupal 7 to 8 migration saga](/blog/2020/migrating-jeffgeerlingcom-drupal-7-drupal-8-how-video-series) in a separate session, so if you've missed the first 13 live stream episodes, check out the session [How I'm migrating JeffGeerling.com from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8](https://cmsphilly.org/talks/how-im-migrating-jeffgeerlingcom-drupal-7-drupal-8) to get caught up—then [subscribe to my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling) to see how it all ends 🤪.

It remains to be seen whether Chris and I will be wearing Hawaiian shirts during the session:
