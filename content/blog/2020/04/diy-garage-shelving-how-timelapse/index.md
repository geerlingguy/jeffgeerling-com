Last weekend, I finally finished off one of a zillion projects my wife and I are tracking in our home improvements Trello board, and, as with most of my projects nowadays, I recorded a timelapse using my [pi-timelapse](https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-timelapse) rig:

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wwaq06ZqSmk" frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

I used [these plans from Ana-White.com](https://www.ana-white.com/blog/2017/01/diy-garage-storage-favorite-plans), and completed the project in about 4 hours total (with a break for dinner and getting the kids in bed). The shelves are quite sturdy, and the only thing I don't particularly like is the way the vertical support beams stick out in front; I'm fearful we might bump into it with the minivan when pulling into the garage. I might put some 45° supports angled into the wall as a backup in case we do knock out one of the legs.

I also chose to go with 2x3 lumber instead of 2x4, mostly because it's lighter than 2x4s and slightly narrower (more space for storing things). It did make the pocket holes a little more awkward (I used my new [Kreg K4 Jig](https://www.amazon.com/Kreg-K4-Pocket-Hole-System/dp/B001DYFISG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=kreg+jig+k4&qid=1585925090&sr=8-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=mmjjg-20&linkId=460de7f943caa977661d21e574cb0cb6&language=en_US) for that!), but in the end it's a pretty solid storage platform, with tons more room than my old dinky particle board shelves!
