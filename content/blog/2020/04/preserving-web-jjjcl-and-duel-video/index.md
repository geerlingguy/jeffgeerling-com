About two decades ago, I built a website for the [National Junior Classical League](https://www.njcl.org)'s individual website competition. This website, [JJJCL](http://jjjcl.jeffgeerling.com/), won a [2nd place award](http://jjjcl.jeffgeerling.com/site_awards.html) for how blindingly brilliant it was. I kept the site puttering along as I moved my static HTML site content from 'homepage.mac.com' to a personal bare metal webserver I ran for a few years, then eventually moved it to the server where I hosted this site (jeffgeerling.com).

But along the transition of this site from Drupal 6 to 7, it seems like that site dropped off the face of the Internet. And with it, part of my (embarrassing, design-wise? sure) history on the web. Luckily, I have archives of practically everything I've ever created, so today I'm happy to announce I have _restored_ that part of my personal history to the Internet, along with another purpose-built static HTML site I built in Apple's short-lived [iTools HomePage](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2000/07/19Apple-Unveils-More-Powerful-and-Easier-to-Use-HomePage-iTool/):

  - [JJJCL - The Latin Supersite!](http://jjjcl.jeffgeerling.com)
  - [Duel of the Seminarians](http://duel.jeffgeerling.com) (an old Star Wars fan film created for a summer camp in 2006)

As I've been mentioning on my [Drupal 7 to 8 migration live streaming series](/blog/2020/migrating-jeffgeerlingcom-drupal-7-drupal-8-how-video-series), it's important to maintain links and content on the web, redirecting things from the old locations to the new in the process. At least, I think so, but I'm a little bit of a data hoarder, so maybe my view is a little tainted.
