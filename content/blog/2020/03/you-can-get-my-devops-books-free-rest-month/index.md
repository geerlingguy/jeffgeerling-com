> **March 31st Update**: Through Device42's generosity, this offer's been [extended through the month of April](/blog/2020/my-devops-books-are-free-april-thanks-device42)!

The ongoing Coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic and bear market made me realize how beneficial it has been to be adaptable in the tech industry. There are no guarantees in life, and the ability to earn a livelihood is probably the most underrated important aspect of overall health. Most people take it for granted until they are deeply affected by it.

I can't do much to help during this crises, but I figure that I can make my two books, [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com) and [Ansible for Kubernetes](https://www.ansibleforkubernetes.com), free for anyone who wants to learn a new skillset as a buffer against possible coming layoffs.

I don't want to seem like a [Henny Penny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henny_Penny) or Chicken Little, but the main takeaway I got from the Great Recession in 2008 was that you should not take your job—or the possibility of finding another like it—for granted. So if you are a student, sysadmin, support representative, or in some other technical field and have been considering learning more about automation and DevOps techniques (especially with Ansible and Kubernetes), I invite you to get one or both of my books.

I made it so you can pay whatever you want for either book—even if that's $0.00—on LeanPub:

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops">{{< figure src="./ansible-for-devops-free-2020.jpg" alt="Ansible for DevOps - Available Free until April" width="238" height="313" class="insert-image" >}}</a> <a href="https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-kubernetes">{{< figure src="./ansible-for-kubernetes-free-2020.jpg" alt="Ansible for Kubernetes - Available Free until April" width="241" height="314" class="insert-image" >}}</a></p>

If you find value in the books, and they do help you either keep your current position, or find some new profitable endeavor, please consider paying back the kindness via [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy), buying a book as a gift for someone else, or some other means. But don't worry about that for now. I'd rather someone who's been on the fence about learning some new tech get the opportunity _now_, and invest some time in themselves in the next few weeks—it's not like [there's anything else you can do](https://www.nytimes.com/article/cancelled-events-coronavirus.html).

I hope layoffs don't happen, but I'd rather be prepared for the worst, so I can enjoy life more when things are going well.

(Note: As with any purchase, if you get the books today, you will _still_ get every update I publish on LeanPub, free forever. I've already updated Ansible for DevOps over 22 times since 2014, and am proud to keep it an extremely relevant learning resource for Ansible.)
