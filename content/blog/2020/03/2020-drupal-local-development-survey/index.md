DrupalCon Minneapolis is two months away, and that means it's time for the [2020 Drupal Local Development Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_7UurduduzKf5DPMakmbQ9Lu8vZKKu8pHyzSFq4UJrNZh5w/viewform?usp=sf_link).

<em>Local development environment usage results from <a href="/blog/2020/2019-drupal-local-development-survey-updated-results">2019's survey</a>.</em>
</p>

If you do any Drupal development work, no matter how much or how little, we would love to hear from you. This survey is not attached to any Drupal organization, it is simply a community survey to help highlight some of the most widely-used tools that Drupalists use for their projects.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_7UurduduzKf5DPMakmbQ9Lu8vZKKu8pHyzSFq4UJrNZh5w/viewform?usp=sf_link">Take the 2020 Drupal Local Development Survey</a></strong></p>

The results will be released around DrupalCon Minneapolis and discussed at the panel: [Local development environments panel discussion](https://events.drupal.org/minneapolis2020/sessions/local-development-environments-panel-discussion).
