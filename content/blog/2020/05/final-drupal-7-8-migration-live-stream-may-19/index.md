> **May 19 Update**: It was a total success, yay! This site is now running Drupal 8.

{{< figure src="./jeffgeerling-drupal7-drupal8-migration-final-episode.jpg" alt="Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 live migration - FINAL EPISODE May 19 at 11 am ET" width="650" height="366" class="insert-image" >}}

Over 100 days in, the big day has finally arrived—it's time to upgrade this website from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8! The entire process has been documented, one hour at a time, in my ['Drupal 7 to 8' live streams](/blog/2020/migrating-jeffgeerlingcom-drupal-7-drupal-8-how-video-series). Visit that link to view all the previous episodes, from setting up a new Drupal codebase, to running the first test `drush migrate-upgrade` command, to upgrading this site's theme from PHPtemplate in Drupal 7 to Twig in Drupal 8.

Some of the highlights:

  - 150+ commits
  - [16 live streams (available on-demand)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLABA8061522EEA245) viewed 7,647 times, plus a [summary presentation at CMS Philly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ajMTN3ukqw&list=PLABA8061522EEA245&index=4&t=0s)
  - [My Drupal 8 Codebase](https://github.com/geerlingguy/jeffgeerling-com) is now open source
  - 5 new issues were opened (or patches tested) on Drupal.org
  - 2 GitHub outages encountered _in the middle of live streams_
  - [Six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4yE0e-Ly74) [Drupal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ-s3DRZJKY) [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Od1LfPMZis) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pX4iPEPA9A) [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Sw47x4UwdA) [highlighted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWjcqE3QKBg)
  - This site's `jeffgeerling` theme was upgraded from PHPTemlate to Twig, and was made more accessible
  - The [#DrupalCares campaign](https://www.drupal.org/association/sustain-da-covid-19) was completely funded, sustaining the Drupal Association this year!

The May 19 episode will air live at **11 a.m. US Eastern**, or 3 p.m. UTC. You can watch it live here: [Drupal 7 to 8 - THE FINAL EPISODE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ehIIFGtMRg)

During the previous stream, **I bought down my production site**—oops! Let's see if we can make some fun things happen in this next and final Drupal live stream!

Subscribe to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling) if you want to be notified when the stream starts (or to see other content around automation, and more Drupal videos in the future!). Or just bookmark this page and come back at 11 a.m. on May 19—the video will play below!
