On November 18th, at 11 a.m., the first episode of my upcoming [Kubernetes 101](https://kube101.jeffgeerling.com) livestream series will start on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling).

The first episode will be available here on YouTube: [Kubernetes 101 - Episode 1 - Hello, Kubernetes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcslsH7OoYo).

You can find more details about the series on my [Kubernetes 101](https://kube101.jeffgeerling.com) site, and there is also an open-source [Kubernetes 101 GitHub repository](https://github.com/geerlingguy/kubernetes-101) which will contain all the code examples for the series.

In the spring, I presented a similar livestream series, [Ansible 101](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/ansible-101-jeff-geerling-youtube-streaming-series), covering all the basics of Ansible and setting people up for success in infrastructure automation.

This series will cover the basics of Kubernetes, including building and deploying containers, managing applications, managing clusters, and more! If you're a total beginner, or even if you're already a pro with containers and want to see what Kubernetes is all about, check out the series, starting November 18th!

I want to also thank [amazee.io](https://www.amazee.io) for sponsoring this series, as their support made it possible for me to finally buy an [Elgato Stream Deck](https://amzn.to/36t2Cig), so I *hopefully* won't forget to unmute myself every live stream :D
