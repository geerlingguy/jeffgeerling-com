This is somewhat of a PSA: There have been many high-profile hacking cases lately where millions of user account passwords have been exposed. If you're anything like the majority of the population, and you're using one password for more than one website, you should stop doing that as soon as possible and switch to a more secure password strategy.

I've outlined what I do on Midwestern Mac's website: <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/my-password-management">My Password Management Strategy</a>.

You can't blame me for one of your accounts being accessed by a hacker! Also, if you're a web developer or application programmer, and you're not salting, stretching, and hashing all user passwords with something like SHA-2, you need to do that <em>yesterday</em>.
