Frank R. O'Brien, owner of <a href="http://www.christyco.com/About_OIH.html">O'Brien Industrial Holdings</a>, has filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Health and Human Services because the recent contraception mandate violates his right to freedom of religious belief.

<a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/missouri-man-first-private-business-owner-sue-hhs-over-contraception-mandate">CBS News reports</a>:

<blockquote>The lawsuit marks the first legal challenge to the HHS mandate from a private business owner and his company. Until now, only religious organizations or institutions have brought lawsuits challenging the mandate. ...

[American Center for Law and Justice representative&nbsp;Francis J. Manion says]&nbsp;"The HHS mandate tells people like Frank O'Brien that they have to choose between conducting their business in a manner consistent with their moral values, or conducting their business in a manner consistent with the government's values. The constitution does not allow the government to impose such a choice."</blockquote>

It'll be interesting to see where this goes. And no, HHS, making insurance companies pay for the contraceptives instead of the small business itself is <a href="/blog/2012/obamas-hhs-concession-no">not different</a>; you're still violating conscience rights, and <a href="/blog/2012/hhs-mandate-why-birth-control">for what?</a>

If you can, please show support (either through prayer or direct contact) for Mr. O'Brien and those who oppose this ridiculous mandate.
