I was honored to appear on <a href="http://thecatholiclovebirds.blogspot.com/">Dustin Faber's</a> 16-bit Catholic podcast this week. We spoke about CNMC 2012 (see <a href="/blog/2012/catholic-new-media-conference-cnmc">my summary post</a>) and some recent news concerning politics and bishops. <a href="http://thecatholiclovebirds.blogspot.com/2012/09/episode-xix-cnmc-2012.html">Give the episode a listen here!</a>
