There's a new blog in town: <a href="http://thiscatholicgirl.wordpress.com/">thiscatholicgirl</a>, by friend and former co-worker <a href="http://twitter.com/ESWesthoff">@ESWesthoff</a> in the Archdiocese of St. Louis. She's witty, funny, and has good insight.

While I'm on the topic of new things, I can't forget to mention that I've been brushing up a bunch of new reviews of microphones and audio devices, and I'm hoping to start testing the iPhone 5 with as many audio gadgets as I can to supplement my article <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/articles/photography/iphone-4-ipad-external-mic-audio-input">External Microphones for iPhone 5, 4S, iPad and iPod Touch Audio input</a>. More to come!
