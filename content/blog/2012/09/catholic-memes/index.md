I meant to post this sooner, just never had time to get around to it... there's a new Catholic Meme site around, aptly named <a href="http://www.catholicmemes.com/">Catholic Memes</a>. An example of what you'll find browsing the site:

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.catholicmemes.com/condescending-wonka/how-convenient-for-you/">{{< figure src="./catholic-meme-church-teaching.jpeg" alt="Wonka Meme - Catholic Meme - Church teaching" width="300" height="300" class="blog-image" >}}</a></p>

There's tons more where <a href="http://www.catholicmemes.com/">that came from</a>. The site is a bit like an expanded <a href="http://www.lolsaints.com/">LOLSaints</a>; whereas LOLSaints.com centers around the lives of the saints, and incorporates little snippets of info about each saint pictured, Catholic Memes puts the message in the meme. Some may call that a bit more shallow, but I think they're funny nonetheless—with a healthy dose of sarcasm!

I'm not sure who runs Catholic Memes, but it looks like their <a href="http://www.catholicmemes.com/rage-comics/ex-nihilo-nihil-fit/">first post</a> was on August 10, 2012, which is not too long ago.
