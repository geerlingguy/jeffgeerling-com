This week I've been visiting doctors, getting checkups, getting tests, and generally being a lab rat. My health has been better, so any prayers you could spare could be appreciated... but enough about me!

Since I've been feeling not-so-good lately, and since the whole <a href="/blog/2012/obamas-hhs-concession-no">HHS mandate fiasco</a>'s been so annoying to me, I've felt relatively pessimistic in the past week.

Well, during one of the many waiting room visits (I hesitate to call them doctor visits, since I usually spend more time in the waiting room ;-), I heard a lullaby play over the hospital's PA system. Nobody seemed to notice it, but I asked one of the receptionists what the lullaby meant (I figured maybe it was employee nap time or something like that, being 3 in the afternoon...).

When she told me that a baby was just born in the labor and delivery area, a little tear caught in my eye. What a great thing to have happen while I was sitting there!

A few days later, I was back in the waiting area for a while, and just before I was called to get a test done, I heard the lullaby again (awesome!)... and about a minute later, another lullaby!

Sometimes these little moments can turn a day around 180°. I'm still pretty happy to have been at the hospital during three births, and I'm reminded that, as Malcolm says in Jurassic Park, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkWeMvrNiOM">Life finds a way</a>." Life finds a way to bring you back to hopefulness. Life finds a way to remind you that death and cancerous beliefs in society (like the contraceptive culture's belief that it's a positive influence) will not be victorious in the end.

I'm feeling a little better now.
