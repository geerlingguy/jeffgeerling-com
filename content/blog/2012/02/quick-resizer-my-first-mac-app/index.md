I've created a few iOS and Android apps for mobile devices and tablets, but just a few days ago, my first 'desktop' app (for Mac OS X 10.7+) was released on the Mac App Store.

Behold, <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/quick-resizer">Quick Resizer</a> (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quick-resizer/id498486288?ls=1&amp;mt=12">$0.99 on the Mac App Store</a>):
<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./quick-resizer-main.png" alt="Quick Resizer Main Screen" width="525" height="328" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I created the app mostly because I realized I would often drag an image to Photoshop to simply resize it from something like 1024x768 to 500 pixels wide, constrained. Quick Resizer makes resizing JPEGs and PNG files super-easy, and everything can be done from the keyboard (or the mouse, if you're so inclined).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Developing for the Mac is a bit different than the iPhone, but Objective-C and the libraries included are very similar, so it wasn't like creating the first iOS app!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you like the app, feel free to rate the app on the Mac App Store after you buy it :)</p>
