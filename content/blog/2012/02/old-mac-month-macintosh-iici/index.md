This month, my old Mac story about a IIci was featured on on the excellent Apple-related blog <a href="http://512pixels.net/">512 Pixels</a>, by Stephen Hackett: <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2012/02/old-mac-of-the-month-macintosh-iici">Old Mac of the Month: Macintosh IIci</a>.
<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./Mac-IIci.jpg" alt="My old Mac IIci" width="525" height="360" class="blog-image" >}}</p>
I briefly mention the IIci in my (not-yet-complete) <a href="/articles/computing/2011/my-computing-history-all-compu">Computing History</a> article here on Life is a Prayer.com. I really liked the IIci, and it's probably one of my favorite Macs of all time, especially considering I probably owned and used it the longest!

Special thanks to my brother and dad, who not only helped me get into electronics and computing, but also helped me edit the article.
