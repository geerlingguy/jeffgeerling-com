As a Catholic who's worked in many different media fields (newspapers, photography, video production, and web development), I've seen a very wide array of copyright violations, improper media usage, and misuse of licensed assets. This seems to happen more in the non-profit world, where there is little or no budget for acquiring stock images, etc.

I'm extremely generous with my licensing for photos and other media I produce; typically, if someone asks to use a photo of mine, I'll send them a full-resolution JPEG and a license that allows them to use it for any non-profit cause.

However, what really gets under my skin is when I find my photos (especially) used in YouTube videos, for articles, and on posters, when I have never even been asked for permission, and when the photos clearly have 'All rights reserved' or some form of Creative Commons license.

The lifted photo.

Today, on Facebook, I noticed that 'Catholic Church' posted a video on YouTube about vocations (titled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGHq1on-x0">Life rooted in God...</a>), and I know the first photo used in that video (a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/3657308867/">photo of now-Bishop Rice</a>) was used without permission, and I'm pretty sure many  of the other photos were, as well.

What the producers of these videos and other media don't realize is that:

<ol>
	<li><strong>It took me a long time to produce that photo</strong> (getting some time in Msgr. Rice's schedule, gathering the equipment, setting up the equipment, taking some 20-40 photos, processing said photos, and retouching the final photo).</li>
	<li><strong>It required the use of over $2,000 of photography equipment</strong>&nbsp;(taking professional-quality photos is <em>not</em> free, and isn't done on one's mobile phone).</li>
	<li><strong>Msgr. Rice never signed a photo release to allow the use of his photo in any videos</strong>&nbsp;(so, I could not have even given permission for this photo to be used in a public YouTube video).</li>
</ol>

Please, please, PLEASE try to always ask permission to use any photos, videos, sounds, music, etc. that is not in the public domain. Please respect the media owners' licensing restrictions and copyright.

<strong>In the end, don't steal other people's work, even if it's for a good cause. The ends, in Catholic morality, never justify the means!</strong>
