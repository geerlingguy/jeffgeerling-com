Here in St. Louis, we're going into our second week of 100°+ temperatures, and even the birds are doing all they can to keep from burning alive! Case in point:

<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./too-hot-for-birds.jpg" alt="Too Hot for the Birds - Robin sunning wings" width="500" height="333" class="blog-image" >}}
Nikon D7000 - 70-200mm f/2.8 @ 1/4000, ISO 800</p>

This robin was sitting splayed out like this for at least five minutes outside my window. Another robin came over and started to do the same thing, but they both flew off after I accidentally hit one of the window blinds and they noticed my hulking 70-200mm lens.

Hummingbirds are also constantly popping back to the feeder my wife has very kindly kept full and fresh for the past couple weeks; I'm amazed these birds aren't just dropping dead in this crazy heat wave!
