<blockquote class="tldr"><strong>tl;dr</strong>: A limited range, inexpensive wide angle zoom that's very sharp on any Nikon FX or DX body.</blockquote>

I bought this lens after accidentally dropping my 18-70mm lens, because I wanted a lens with a little less distortion than the common kit lenses I'd been using for a few years, and I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it.

I kept the lens for almost a year, and used it a bit for indoor event photography and some landscape/general photography, but I often found myself keeping the much cheaper, but much sharper and wider-apertured 35mm f/1.8 DX on my camera instead.

<h3>The Good Parts</h3>

There were three main reasons I chose this lens to replace my broken 18-70mm lens:

<ul>
<li>The lens is pretty cheap used. I picked up my copy for about $300. You can usually find them here and there on Craigslist or eBay.</li>
<li>The lens is a brick. It feels pretty solid, has a metal mount, and besides the bulging front part surrounding the front lens, everything feels like it would survive a few drops.</li>
<li>It's sharp; sharper than most kit lenses throughout the whole zoom range, in fact.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Bad Parts</h3>

There were a few things I didn't like about the lens that ultimately led me to sell it and buy another wide zoom:

<ul>
<li>The zoom ring is a bit narrow, making it difficult to quickly grab it and change the focal length.</li>
<li>Images were sharp, but the colors and distortion didn't live up to my expectation. (Nothing really 'popped' in the pictures I took with this lens.</li>
<li>The front part of the lens pops out a little bit too much, making the lens an interesting fit into camera bags, and the lens hood makes the lens look a little unbalanced.</li>
<li>The zoom range (18-35mm) is limited enough that I found a prime or two to be a much better value in my bag.</li>
</ul>

<em>Caveat</em>: This review is coming primarily from my experience with this lens on a DX body, and I'm comparing it mostly to other <em>DX</em> lenses. For FX users, the lens might provide a bit more value, as it is a pretty wide lens for not much money.

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./rome-vittorio-emmanuele-18-35.jpg" alt="Rome - Monument to Vittorio Emmanuele with 18-35mm" width="500" height="331" class="blog-image" >}}

On the whole, though, the 18-35mm is a decent lens, and is pretty light compared to most of the better-performing zooms (especially the f/2.8 glass I prefer!). It's a decent value, but it's hard to justify lugging it around when you can get either a much larger zoom range in one of Nikon's recent kit lenses (with similar sharpness and aperture range), or much better light-gathering capabilities in a prime or two in the same range (24mm, 35mm...).

You can pick up a used 18-35mm lens for around <span itemprop="price">$500</span> from a used camera shop, eBay or Craigslist.
