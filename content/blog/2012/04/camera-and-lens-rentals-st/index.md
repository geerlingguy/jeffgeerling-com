For the past few years, when shooting large events in indoor spaces (such as the <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/photos/galleries/2010-priesthood-ordination">2010 Priesthood Ordination Mass</a>), I've rented camera bodies and lenses from <a href="http://www.borrowlenses.com/">BorrowLenses.com</a>, a great online rental store, with pretty much any lens or camera body you'd ever want to use (especially if you're like me and could never justify the cost of purchase!). I highly recommend BorrowLenses (though I have also used and liked LensRentals.com and RentGlass.com).

This year, however, I decided to look into whether it might be more advantageous to use a local camera shop. I found that both <a href="http://www.schillers.com/">Schiller's</a> and <a href="http://www.cccamera.com/">Creve Coeur Camera</a> offer camera and lens rentals, but both have more limited selections. However, the lens and camera body I need are usually available at Schiller's, I don't have to pay shipping (pick-up only, but the store is nearby), and I can pay a one-day rental rate for a weekend (most of the events I use the cameras for are on Saturdays).

So, this year, I've saved over $100 in shipping/insurance fees by renting locally. And, I got to talk to someone over the phone to get everything sorted out.

If you live in St. Louis and need one of the $1,500+ Nikon lenses or $5,000+ Nikon camera bodies for a day or two, I'd highly recommend Schiller's. (I don't recommend CCC only because their prices are a little higher, and I've had some bad customer experiences with them in the past).
