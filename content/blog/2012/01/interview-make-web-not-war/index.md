A recent interview focusing on my involvement in open source development (mostly centering around my work with <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/'>Open Source Catholic</a>) was published on Micosoft/Canada's <a href="http://www.webnotwar.ca/">Make Web Not War</a> website:

In the interview, I speak about my involvement in Drupal, and my appreciation for a variety of different open source projects. I'm glad Microsoft is putting some resources behind sites like 'Make Web Not War', and I hope they continue to reach out into different developer communities.

They still have a stigma of being closed and have tech that's hard to develop for (which, in some cases, is true), but that could change (it <em>is</em>&nbsp;changing, but very slowly)...
