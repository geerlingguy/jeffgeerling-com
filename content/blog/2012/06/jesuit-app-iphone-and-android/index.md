The Jesuit Conference today <a href="http://www.jesuit.org/blog/index.php/2012/06/take-the-jesuits-with-you-via-your-iphone-or-ipad-new-app-allows-users-to-find-nearby-jesuit-institutions-latest-news-and-jesuit-prayers/">announced</a> the release of the <a href="http://www.jesuit.org/about/press-and-publications/mobile/">Jesuit App</a>, a mobile app that lets people find Jesuit locations in the US, see Jesuit news, and view Jesuit prayers and spiritual works.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jesuit-app/id528931840?mt=8&uo=4">{{< figure src="./iphone-jesuit-app.png" alt="Jesuit App for iOS" width="160" height="300" class="blog-image" >}}</a></p>

The Jesuit Conference hired me a few months ago to build this app for them, and it's the third iOS app I've built, and the second Android App. I built the app on top of the open source <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/project/catholic-diocese-app">Catholic Diocese App</a>, and hope to continue making that project more flexible, and even easier for Catholic Dioceses and organizations to adopt for their own great mobile apps.
