Every so often, I like to document my workspace. Lately, there's been a trend to go completely minimalist for a workspace (it seems to be the fad these days), and I've seen pictures of people with just <a href="http://coderwall.com/p/rqjk2w">a MacBook Air on a matress on the floor</a>. Or a <a href="http://coderwall.com/p/gcymlg">MacBook air sitting on some exotic slab of wood</a> with a simple coffee mug next to it.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/7375742322/" title="My Workstation (2012) by geerlingguy, on Flickr">{{< figure src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7220/7375742322_74113648f6_z.jpg" alt="My Workstation (2012)" width="640" height="424" >}}</a>
My 2012 workspace. (D7000, 17-55 2.8 - f/8 at 1/100s, SB-25 bounced off ceiling).</p>

Well, my workspace has never been quite like that. I'm not just a writer or a coder; I do programming, photography, tech repair (less often nowadays, but still...), and a bunch of other little tasks that require more than just a laptop with a keyboard.

You may remember when I posted a picture/post about <a href="/blog/2010/my-workstation-work">my workspace when I worked with the Archdiocese of St. Louis</a>, or even earlier, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/3088787766/">from 2008 at my apartment in St. Louis</a>. Since I work from home now, my 'at work' and 'at home' workspaces are one and the same.

Over <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/7375742322/">on the Flickr page</a>, I provide a ton of little notes (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/7375742322/">go there</a> and hover over the image), along with a more in-depth description of everything. But the main thing I notice since the earlier 2008 picture is that I've substantially trimmed down the amount of computers I work with on a daily basis. I now just use my iPad and MacBook Air for everything (the Air has Parallels running Ubuntu Linux, Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8).

It's also amazing to think that this little MacBook Air packs more punch (processor-wise) than my old 24" iMac Extreme from 2007. It's more than adequate for most of my needs, but I'm definitely keeping my eyes open for a faster Mac that'll cut down on time in Aperture rendering 30+ MB RAW files and compiling apps in Xcode and Eclipse...
