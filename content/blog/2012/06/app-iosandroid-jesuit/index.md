The <a href="http://www.jesuit.org/">Jesuit Conference</a> partnered with Midwestern Mac, LLC to create a new app for the 450-year old Society of Jesus; the app includes three sections—Locations, News and Prayers—that offer users the ability to find Jesuit retreat centers, parishes, and schools, follow along with Jesuit news from National Jesuit News, and join in with users around the world in different Jesuit prayers and spiritual works.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Download the app:</strong> <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jesuit-app/id528931840?mt=8&uo=4">iTunes Link</a> | Android Link (coming soon!)</p>

The App for iOS was built on top of the <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/project/catholic-diocese-app">Catholic Diocese App</a>, an open source project originally created by Midwestern Mac after the development of Catholic STL (for the Archdiocese of St. Louis). The Android version of the app (not yet available) was built natively for Android devices, on an entirely new (and now open-source) codebase, <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/Catholic-Diocese-App-Android">Catholic Diocese App for Android</a>.

Midwestern Mac, LLC has created other iOS and Android apps in the past, and has built on that experience to develop a solid set of apps for the Jesuit conference. You can read more about the app on the Jesuit Conference website: <a href="http://www.jesuit.org/blog/index.php/2012/06/take-the-jesuits-with-you-via-your-iphone-or-ipad-new-app-allows-users-to-find-nearby-jesuit-institutions-latest-news-and-jesuit-prayers/">New App allows Users to Find Nearby Jesuit Institutions, Latest News and Jesuit Prayers</a>.
