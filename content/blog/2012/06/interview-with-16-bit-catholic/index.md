{{< figure src="./halo-4-master-chief.png" alt="Halo 4 Master Chief" width="300" height="169" class="blog-image" >}}In a break from normal events, I <a href="http://thecatholiclovebirds.blogspot.com/2012/06/16-bit-catholic-06-09-2012.html">talked with a Twitter friend Dustin Faber tonight about gaming</a>. Many people who follow this blog and follow me on Facebook might know I enjoy video games, but they might not know <em>how much</em> I enjoy them :)

My brother and I both played a ton of arcade and early computer and console games growing up, and I currently play games in the Halo series and a little Minecraft from time to time. Not as often as I did before I met my beautiful bride, but still here and there when I need a diversion.

The 16-Bit Catholic (<a href="http://twitter.com/16bitcatholic">@16bitcatholic</a> on Twitter) interviewed Stephen Baumgartner (<a href="http://twitter.com/holy_Spork">@holy_Spork</a>) and me for today's episode, and we talked about our impressions of this year's E3, some other gaming-related news (Xbox and Playstation games, the Wii U, etc.), and booth babes (i.e. gaming companies going over the line with their objectification of women).

<a href="http://thecatholiclovebirds.blogspot.com/2012/06/16-bit-catholic-06-09-2012.html">Listen to the podcast episode from the 16-bit Catholic!</a>

(<em>Trivia</em>: The lead-in song for the podcast is from one of my favorite NES games, Mega Man 2!).
