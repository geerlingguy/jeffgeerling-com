Sarah Reinhard is starting a new column, <a href="http://catholicmom.com/category/tech-talk/">Tech Talks</a>, on CatholicMom.com, where she interviews Catholics in tech (like myself). I was excited to be asked to participate in the first interview: <a href="http://catholicmom.com/2012/06/04/catholic-techie-jeff-geerling/">Catholic Techie Jeff Geerling</a>.

Speaking of tech-related things, this weekend I worked almost a full day on porting the <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/project/catholic-diocese-app">Catholic Diocese App</a> over to Android, and I'm getting pretty close. I have most of the functionality working, but there are quite a few rough edges. More to come!
