I posted this to my personal site, but I wanted to mention it on this blog, as it's a performance optimization that I use quite often when programming for the web or for native applications: <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/articles/computing/2012/dont-wait-delegate-proper-use">Don't Wait, Delegate! Proper use of threading and queueing</a>.

<blockquote>
There are hundreds of ways you can improve your app or website's performance, but few have the potential to improve your app or website's responsiveness as much as queueing or using background processes.
