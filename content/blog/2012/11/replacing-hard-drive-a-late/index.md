A friend of mine had an older 2008 MacBook Pro (the kind that does <em>not</em> have the modern 'unibody' construction), and he noticed it was getting slower. He upgraded the RAM to max it out at 4 GB (I think it might be able to go to 6 or 8 GB if needed). But a lot of things took a long time to do, even though the Mac had a 1.86 Ghz Core 2 Duo processor (not a slouch by any means).

He asked me to replace the hard drive with an SSD, so I did. I followed <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Core+2+Duo+Model+A1211+Hard+Drive+Replacement/459/1">this iFixIt guide</a>, and put in a new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008U00BUG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B008U00BUG&linkCode=as2&tag=mmjjg-20">OCZ Agility 256GB SSD</a>, which is way faster (especially for random access, like when you boot the computer or launch an app) than the old disk drive that I removed from the MacBook Pro.

I recorded the entire process (about 23 minutes) using my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042X9LCO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0042X9LCO&linkCode=as2&tag=mmjjg-20">Nikon D7000</a> along with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006I523/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00006I523&linkCode=as2&tag=mmjjg-20">Audio Technica PRO88W wireless microphone</a>, and posted it on YouTube:
