Midwestern Mac is proud to announce <a href="https://servercheck.in/">Server Check.in—a website and server monitoring service</a> that is inexpensive and easy to use.

Server Check.in was built because, while there are some really powerful and flexible monitoring solutions out there, like <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a> (we love Pingdom!), there aren't any really simple and inexpensive services that are better for individuals and small businesses who don't have a budget for more expensive and involved solutions, but still need to know when their servers or sites go down.

Server Check.in offers many features like free, unlimited SMS messages for outage notices, email notifications, and server latency monitoring. It will check on up to five servers or websites every fifteen minutes, and notify you when the servers and sites go down.

<a href="https://servercheck.in/user/register">Sign up here for only $15/year</a>—that's just $1.25 per month!
