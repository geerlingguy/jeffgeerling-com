During today's Mass of Priesthood Ordination at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, I was waiting for the procession to start outside the entrance, and decided to stand in the garden between the Cathedral and the rectory for a few minutes, even though the sun was beating down (93°F in the morning!).

I was rewarded with a wonderful shot of this interesting little bug:

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/7277161886/" title="Daisy Bug by geerlingguy, on Flickr">{{< figure src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8143/7277161886_d6dd6a6d40.jpg" alt="Daisy Bug" width="500" height="331" >}}</a></p>

I haven't done a lot of flower/closeup photography in a while, but it seems this picture turned out just right, without any work. It was a nice little moment in a rather hectic day.

I'll be posting tons of pictures from the Ordination on Flickr soon. Working on processing them now (I've already whittled down over 1,000 photos to 450ish).
