I'll be attending the <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/">2012 Catholic New Media Conference</a> in Dallas/Fort Worth from August 29-31; will I see you there? This year will be the largest CNMC yet, with a ton of great speakers and separate tracks for different days of the conference.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/">{{< figure src="./cnmc-2012.png" alt="CNMC 2012" width="460" height="71" class="blog-image" >}}</a></p>

This year's <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/marketing-your-message/">theme</a> is <em>Marketing Your Message</em>, and the main track of the CNMC Professional Day will be filled with keynote speakers talking about this theme. At the same time, <a href="http://fallibleblogma.com/">Matthew Warner</a> and I will be leading a <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/2012/05/21/cnmc-tech-summit-announced/">Tech Summit</a>, meant for Catholic app and web developers, designers, and Catholic development companies, talking about apps, APIs, web development, and collaboration.

I'll probably talk a bit about the <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/Catholic-Diocese-App">Catholic Diocese App</a> (with some great new news on that front to be announced!), <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/">Open Source Catholic</a>, and some other projects and topics near and dear to my heart.

If you can make it, we'd love to see you. There's more for everyone, as there will also be two more days jam-packed with great speakers and opportunities for growth—Thursday is the Celebration and Networking Day, and Friday is the International Bloggers' Summit.

Hope to <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/">see you there</a>!
