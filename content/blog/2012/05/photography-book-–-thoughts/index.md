I recently told my Facebook friends that I was thinking of writing a book to help people get better photos with their fancy cameras, and received a lot of positive feedback.

<p style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="./jansen-birth-baby.jpg" alt="Jansen Baby Birthday" width="500" height="331" class="blog-image" >}}
Getting consistently sharp, vivid, interesting photos doesn't have to be hard.</p>

Some of the things I want to write about include:

<ul>
	<li>Getting photos that aren't too bright or too dark.</li>
	<li>Getting photos where people aren't blurry.</li>
	<li>Making people look great.</li>
	<li>Taking pictures that are beautiful, more often.</li>
</ul>

I don't want to be technical in this book, other than introducing people, slowly, to important concepts in photography. I want to show people through example and experience exactly what's going on when they snap a picture that they later find to be ugly, horrible, or too blurry or bright/dark to use.

What are some other things that you might want to learn in a book on basic photography, and how you can make more pictures that are beautiful? I'd love to know!
