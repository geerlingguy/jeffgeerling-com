...at least if you have a family, and need to transport datacenter racks.

Consider this:

  - You can fit full 4' x 8' plywood sheets in the back (assuming you fold down/remove the seats)
  - You can fit up to 12' long dimensional lumber (1x2, 2x4, etc.) inside (passing it through the gap between front seats)
  - You can seat 7 or even _8_ people inside, somewhat comfortably, with at least 2-3 cupholders per person (still preserving 20-30 ft<sup>3</sup> ((0.8m<sup>3</sup>) of storage space in the back!)
  - You can fit a full 42" deep 42U datacenter rack in the back, with space left over for one or two 2U 1500VA UPSes

All that, and all 140ft<sup>3</sup> (4.2m<sup>3</sup>) of interior storage is fully enclosed and climate-controlled.

The minivan wins, hands-down, unless you're dealing in raw materials. A sunroof isn't that helpful for loading in piles of dirt and gravel.
