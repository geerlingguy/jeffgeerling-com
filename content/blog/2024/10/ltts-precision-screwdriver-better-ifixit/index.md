Two years ago, Linus Sebastian released a general purpose ratcheting screwdriver tailored towards PC building and IT needs. I [reviewed the LTT Screwdriver](/blog/2022/youtuber-built-tool-beat-snap-on), and found it to be a good tool that _did_ improve a couple things where it counted: the ratchet mechanism was useful for a broad range of lighter tasks, and the in-handle bit storage was a creative improvement over the patented MegaPro Automotive design the LTT Screwdriver was based on.

The price of the LTT Screwdriver was about $15-20 more than I think it's worth, but it's still a good enough driver you can justify paying extra. I bought three LTT Screwdrivers and have one on each of my workbenches at home and at the studio!

In this post (and in the video that goes along with it, embedded below), I test whether Linus and his team can strike gold twice—after selling [hundreds of thousands of the full-size screwdriver](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/y2f6rr/ltt_has_sold_over_6_million_in_screw_drivers/#), they've released a [Precision Screwdriver and Bit Set](https://www.lttstore.com/products/precision-multi-bit-screwdriver-bundle).

If you think their overall product looks similar to iFixit's Moray or Mako kits... you're not alone.

The LTT Precision Screwdriver and Bit Set definitely draw inspiration from iFixit's similar [Precision Bit Driver](https://www.ifixit.com/products/mako-driver-kit-64-precision-bits) product line, but Linus points out in a [recent WAN show episode](https://youtu.be/MK12g18m8ns?t=430):

> Either it's a copy at a higher price, in which case he shouldn't be worried about it.
> OR, it's a product that innovated...

He lists off a number of improvements, like a magnetic detachable hinge for the case and a magnetic parts tray, among other features.

{{< figure src="./ltt-precision-screwdriver-and-ifixit-bit-driver.jpeg" alt="LTT Precision Screwdriver and iFixit Bit Driver held by Jeff" width="700" height="auto" class="insert-image" >}}

There _are_ improvements, but as Linus mentioned, the full LTT kit is also more expensive, coming in at a discounted $49.99 (currently on backorder).

What prompted Linus' WAN show discussion was [this tweet](https://x.com/kwiens/status/1834255570888749321) from Kyle Wiens, iFixit's CEO. In response to someone asking LTT to design a soldering iron after iFixit introduced theirs, Kyle wrote:

> He does seem to be good at copying our products.

I reached out to Kyle before writing this blog post, and I'll provide his statement later.

When it comes down to it, though, the main practical difference—the only major thing that I really noticed when using both kits—is the fidget spinner integrated into the end of the LTT Precision Screwdriver.

{{< figure src="./ltt-precision-screwdriver-ifixit-bit-driver-ends.jpeg" alt="LTT Precision Screwdriver fidget spinner compared to iFixit Moray driver" width="700" height="auto" class="insert-image" >}}

In the video above, I did a couple silly tests, comparing the fidget spinner's spinning action against a [mini fidget spinner](https://amzn.to/3A83Mmg) I found on Amazon, and VHB-taped to the top of the iFixit driver.

Both fidgets spin well, giving on average around 25 seconds of spin time. And on my hand-held tachometer, I saw the LTT spinner get up beyond 2500 rpm. If you like fidget spinners, this is certainly... another fidget spinner.

It's just that precision driver kits are more about the bits than the drivers—indeed, at home I have maybe 5 different bit drivers, and I don't normally care which one I pick up, they'll all do in a pinch.

Unlike the larger driver, the integrated bit storage doesn't come in as handy, because on projects where I need a precision driver, I usually need a bit that's not one of the three I have stored in the lid.

And in that case, I still prefer to use my [14-in-1 Klein](https://amzn.to/4fJ00yT), just because I don't have to find a spot to set the bit holder case on my bench—assuming I have a flat surface nearby to place it at all!

## Statement from iFixit's CEO

After seeing the Xeet/Tweet I mentioned earlier, I reached out to Kyle Wiens, and he replied:

> I haven't seen their new screwdriver set myself yet, so I can't comment on the quality. We've put a lot of effort into optimizing the exact selection of bits that our community wants. We carefully designed the selection using the repair knowledge accumulated hosting over a hundred thousand repair guides. An example: we added the triangle bit, which really isn't found many other places, to enable toys like the ones that come in McDonald's happy meals as well as certain coffee machine models.

> We're pausing a number of our media sponsorships right now as we are gearing up to teach the world to solder. I'm really excited about the potential of the FixHub Smart Iron—we want to make soldering so easy, anyone can do it.

I don't think there's bad blood between LMG and iFixit, but the Precision Screwdriver definitely changed their relationship. I've still seen a few iFixit integrations on other tech YouTube channels, [like this JayzTwoCents video](https://youtu.be/H7skQTdOSSM?t=35) posted just last week. The Screwdriver launch certainly didn't _hinder_ iFixit's efforts to axe 2024 sponsor integrations on LMG channels!

And the FixHub Smart Iron does look intriguing—[Dave Jones / EEVBlog just posted a review and teardown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRSP647qda4) that's worth a watch.

## Recommendation

The LTT Precision Screwdriver isn't a _bad screwdriver_... it's just a _bad value_. The unique features—at least in _my_ use—don't justify spending $10-20 more, and waiting a week or more for shipping.

Especially when I can buy the [iFixit Mako on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4foTlcW) for $40 with 1-2 day shipping, and a flex extension to boot!

If you really like one of the features the LTT kit adds, like the integrated bit storage, all metal screwdriver body, or hinged/magnetic-part-tray lid, then maybe you can justify the extra $10-20. Or, if you just like the LTT YouTube channel and want to support the creator, be my guest.

There are certainly worse precision screwdrivers; this one's great! It's just not worth paying extra for a built-in fidget spinner.
