In 2020, I got serious about [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling) after seeing explosive growth from a series on the [Turing Pi Raspberry Pi cluster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgVz4-SEhbE&list=PL2_OBreMn7Frk57NLmLheAaSSpJLLL90G). Early in 2021, the success of [my books](/books) and the YouTube channel resulted in me [quitting my last paid consulting gig](https://twitter.com/geerlingguy/status/1347217998675898368), and focusing all my time on [Hosted Apache Solr](https://hostedapachesolr.com), writing, and making videos.

In 2021 the channel went from just under 100,000 subscribers to 253,000 (and counting!):

Video views went from about 6 million to _21 million_, as a few of my Raspberry Pi-related videos took off (though I wouldn't consider any of my videos 'viral'—most get a slow 'wave' of growth if they get popular).

## Patreon and GitHub Sponsors

There's no way I could've quit my full-time job and consulting gig without the support of a few hundred viewers on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy) and many supporters of my open source work on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy). The growth in sponsorship on both platforms is closely in step:

Thank you to everyone who's supported my work—the financial support through Patreon and GitHub Sponsors helps me pay my health insurance and utilities, without which I'd be in a rough spot :)

The revenue from my books and ads on the YouTube videos pays the mortgage and the rest of my bills, and allows me to save a small amount of money—nowhere near the consulting income I had the previous two years, but enough to maintain a healthy Midwestern lifestyle for a family of six!

## Red Shirt Jeff Special

Since I needed a little time at the end of the year, and 'compilation' videos are comparatively easy to produce (compared to original content, which typically takes at _minimum_ four hours per final minute of video), Red Shirt Jeff finally gets his time to shine:

See you in 2022!
