Early this year, I passed a major milestone on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling)—100,000 subscribers!

I've had a channel since 2006, but never really devoted time to it until last year, and I'm blown away by the positive response I've gotten publishing videos [on Raspberry Pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLBdi8B5Wgk&list=PL2_OBreMn7FqeHztTB3BCMGJ_dx1jEK3f), [Kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcslsH7OoYo&list=PL2_OBreMn7FoYmfx27iSwocotjiikS5BD), [Ansible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goclfp6a2IQ&list=PL2_OBreMn7FqZkvMYt6ATmgC0KAGGJNAN) and more.

To celebrate the milestone, I created a 'how it's made' video where I go behind the scenes and show how I made—from start to finish—my [Argon One M.2 Raspberry Pi Case review video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLBdi8B5Wgk).

Here's that video, in case you ever wondered how one of my videos is made, end-to-end: [100K How I make YouTube videos - BTS Office / Studio Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajsq4H9zu-E).

If you're interested in any of the gear I use, I have links to _everything_ I mentioned in the video in the video's description on YouTube.
