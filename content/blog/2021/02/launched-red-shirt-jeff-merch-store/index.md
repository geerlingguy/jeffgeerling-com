It makes me throw up a little in my mouth to say this, because it's such a _YouTuber_ thing to do... but I now have an official merch store to go along with [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling):

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="">{{< figure src="./redshirtjeff-store-launch.jpg" alt="Red Shirt Jeff store - launch products" width="600" height="508" class="insert-image" >}}</a></p>

The [Red Shirt Jeff store](https://redshirtjeff.com) has original designs that I find interesting or funny, and there are three shirt designs available at launch:

  - [It has been 0 days since I recompiled the Linux kernel](https://redshirtjeff.com/listing/linux-recompile-shirt?product=211) (also available in a [Women's version](https://redshirtjeff.com/listing/linux-recompile-shirt?product=370)).
  - [Release the Magic Smoke](https://redshirtjeff.com/listing/release-the-magic-smoke?product=46)
  - [Hard Drive & RAID-Z2](https://redshirtjeff.com/listing/hard-drive-and-raid-z2?product=46)
