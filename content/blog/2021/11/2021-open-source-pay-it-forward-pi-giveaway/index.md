This year, I wanted to solve two problems:

  1. Open source projects and maintainers often get no reward (even a simple word of thanks!) for their efforts maintaining the tools we rely on every day.
  2. I have a box full of really awesome Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 boards and products like the [CutiePi](https://cutiepi.io), a [PiBox mini 2](http://pibox.io), and a [MirkoPC](https://hackaday.io/project/177626-mirkopc-cm4-carrier-board)!

To solve both problems, I'm doing a giveaway—to enter to win one of any of the pictured items below (and maybe a few others I can find lurking in my office), just donate or say thank you to any open source project or maintainer, then [submit your entry](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6P__4zbN2wmloqFlRzzsHkextmJeVFzza7cQ18OAYwW-mNA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

{{< figure src="./oss-giveaway-items.jpeg" alt="OSSThanks Giveaway items" width="600" height="397" class="insert-image" >}}

The drawing will be at random and should be held next Friday, so please make sure to fill out the entry form by then!

I'm not going to save anyone's email address or sell your data, this giveaway is just to achieve the two goals stated at the top, nothing more. Good luck, and spread some [#OSSThanks](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OSSThanks&src=typed_query&f=live) this year!
