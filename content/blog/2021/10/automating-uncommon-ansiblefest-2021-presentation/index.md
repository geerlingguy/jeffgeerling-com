At [AnsibleFest 2021](https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest), I presented a session titled [Automating the Uncommon - Ansible automates everything!](https://events.ansiblefest.redhat.com/widget/redhat/ansible21/sessioncatalog/session/1623188193094001Pgn7?intcmp=701f20000012ngPAAQ).

Since watching on-demand versions of the AnsibleFest sessions requires a signup, I thought I'd also post the session to my YouTube channel, so everyone can learn from it without registering. The session seemed well-received, and I hope it shows that, as I state in my 'Rule of Golden Hammers':

I demonstrate how I use Ansible to:

  - Automate my home Internet monitoring and access with [Internet Pi](https://github.com/geerlingguy/internet-pi).
  - Automate the [Pi Dramble](https://www.pidramble.com) website I run in my basement with [Drupal Pi](https://github.com/geerlingguy/drupal-pi).
  - Update Ansible `requirements.yml` files with my [Ansible Requirements Updater](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-requirements-updater).
  - Provision and synchronize the configuration on my Macs with the [Mac Dev Playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook).
  - Template out HTML for my [Ansible content website](https://ansible.jeffgeerling.com).
