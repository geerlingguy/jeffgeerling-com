For Pi Day, I'm going to livestream my second attempt at getting 16 hard drives (well, 12 hard drives and 4 SSDs) recognized by a Raspberry Pi.

The [first attempt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afnszOuWt74) went decently well... but I wound up running into power supply issues.

<div class="yt-embed"><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HPI5B9QNCY4" frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

This time around, I will hopefully have those issues solved, and also we may have a little fun building a software-RAID-on-hardware-RAID (depending on how crazy we want to get). It probably won't work like I expect, but _that's what makes it fun!_.

[Subscribe to my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling) and turn on notifications if you want to be notified when the stream starts. Or, don't do that and just come back on Sunday at 3 p.m. US Central time :)
