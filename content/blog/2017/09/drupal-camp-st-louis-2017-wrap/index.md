The St. Louis Drupal Users Group ([STLDUG](https://www.drupalstl.org)) just finished it's [fourth Drupal Camp](https://2017.drupalstl.org), held at UMSL yesterday. I had a great time meeting with everyone, and am excited for next year! Last year I had to miss the Camp due to unexpected surgery, but this year I was able to attend and even bring some of my photo gear, to take pictures (I love contributing to open source through means other than code!); here's the obligatory 'whole camp' photo:

You can view all my photos from the camp in an album on Flickr: [Drupal Camp St. Louis 2017 photos by geerlingguy](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/sets/72157687065355313)

Due to a session slot becoming available just a few days before the Camp, I delivered a slightly-modified version of my MidCamp presentation on [Drupal VM for Drupal 8 Development](https://2017.drupalstl.org/sessions/drupal-vm-drupal-8-development), and you can see the video embedded below:

Speaking of session videos... thanks again to Kevin Thull / Blue Drop Shop for recording [ALL the sessions (including the keynote and closing remarks)](https://2017.drupalstl.org/news/keynote-and-all-session-videos-drupal-camp-st-louis-2017), and posting them to YouTube. All the sessions were available on YouTube before we even started Happy Hour at Ferguson Brewing Company after the Camp was over!

I hope to see you _next_ year at Drupal Camp St. Louis 2018—date TBA.
