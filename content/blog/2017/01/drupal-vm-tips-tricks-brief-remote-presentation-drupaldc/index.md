Yesterday I presented [Drupal VM Tips & Tricks](https://www.meetup.com/drupal-dc/events/235934625/) at the DrupalDC meetup, remotely. I didn't have a lot of time to prepare anything for the presentation, but I thought it would be valuable to walk through some of the neat features of Drupal VM people might not know about.

Here's the video from the presentation:

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wV6MDsT42Y" frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
