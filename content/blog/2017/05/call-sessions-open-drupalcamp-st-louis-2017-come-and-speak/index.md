[DrupalCamp St. Louis 2017](https://2017.drupalstl.org) will be held **September 22-23, 2017**, in St. Louis, Missouri. This will be our fourth year hosting a DrupalCamp, and we're one of the best camps for new presenters!

If you did something amazing with Drupal, if you're an aspiring themer, site builder, or developer, or if you are working on making the web a better place, we'd love for you to [**submit a session**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSepKI6mquZzUMh3rfDHxbkeCM70okPzjNOS9Tf9TRv7-tufmA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Session submissions are due by August 1.

This year's Camp will kick off with a full day of Drupal training on Friday, September 22, then a full day of sessions and community networking on Saturday, September 23. Come and join us at DrupalCamp St. Louis—we'd love to see you! (Registration will open soon.)
