I'm excited to be presenting at this year's DrupalCon Baltimore on a topic near and dear to my heart: I'll be presenting [Just Keep Swimming: Don't drown in your open source project!](https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/sessions/just-keep-swimming-dont-drown-your-open-source-project) at DrupalCon next month.

On a basic level, I'll outline ways I deal with rage-inducingly-vague bug reports, hundreds of GitHub notifications per day, angry and entitled users, and keep a positive attitude that allows me to continue to contribute on a daily basis.

This will be my first time presenting in the _Being Human_ track, but I'm excited because in a lot of ways, it's the DrupalCon track that I get the most out of—what good is the work we do if we can't tie it back to our own identity, our community, and ultimately a sense of relationship with other people? There are [many other great sessions in the _Being Human_](https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/sessions/accepted/being-human) track; if you're a DrupalCon veteran and have spent most of your time in the more technical sessions (and even the 'hallway track'), you're missing out on a wealth of knowledge gained through the community's collective experience!

The [Birds of a Feather schedule](https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/birds-feather) was also just posted, so please add a BoF if you're interested in discussing some aspect of Drupal, Open Source, community, etc. (I just added a BoF to discuss [Managing Drupal sites with Composer](https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/bofs/managing-drupal-sites-composer), as that's a topic that I deal with on a daily basis, and there's surely room for improvement!)
