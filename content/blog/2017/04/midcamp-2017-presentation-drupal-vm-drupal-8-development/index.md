MidCamp is one of my favorite Drupal events—it hits the sweet spot (at least for me) in terms of diversity, topics, and camp size. I was ecstatic when one of my session submissions was accepted, and just finished presenting [Developing for Drupal 8 with Drupal VM](https://www.midcamp.org/session/developing-drupal-8-drupal-vm).

<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/geerlingguy/drupal-vm-for-drupal-8-dev-midcamp-2017">{{< figure src="./drupal-vm-presentation.png" alt="Drupal VM presentation slide" width="650" height="366" class="insert-image" >}}</a>

You can see slides from the presentation here: [Drupal VM for Drupal 8 Development](https://www.slideshare.net/geerlingguy/drupal-vm-for-drupal-8-dev-midcamp-2017), but without the full video there are a lot of gaps (especially on slides where there's just a giant emoji!). Luckily, Kevin Thull of [Blue Drop Shop](http://bluedropshop.com) is hard at work recording _all_ the sessions and posting them to YouTube. He's already processed the video from my session, and it's available below:

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4BqUo0GzVs" frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

This presentation walks through the basic steps involved in using Drupal VM for both Local and Production environments, following along with the blog post I published recently, [Soup to Nuts: Using Drupal VM to build local and prod](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/soup-nuts-using-drupal-vm-build-local-and-prod). Some of the topics covered include:

  - How to get started with Drupal VM
  - How to build an identical local and production environment using Drupal VM
  - How to add Apache Solr to Drupal VM and your Drupal site for supercharged search
  - How to add Behat tests to Drupal VM so you can use Behavior Driven Development
  - Features that are planned for inclusion in future Drupal VM versions

It's probably the best summary of what's currently happening with Drupal VM, so if you're a current user, at least skim through to the end of the video to get a glimpse of some of the new features, as well as what's to come!
