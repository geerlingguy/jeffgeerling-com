The organizers behind [DrupalCamp St. Louis 2017](https://2017.drupalstl.org) are happy to announce we have a speaker scheduled to present the Keynote, Adam Bergstein—Associate Director of Engineering at CivicActions!

Adam's Keynote is titled "Restoring Our Lost Imagination", and here's a short summary:

> Experience helps shape our perspective. Somewhere along the way, our youthful imagination fades away and our reality forms predisposition. How can we bring back our imagination to achieve things we don’t think are possible? This talk explores how to recognize what we believe to be limitations and ways to use our imagination in routine opportunities. Only when we free ourselves from our own biases, can we reach our fullest potential.
