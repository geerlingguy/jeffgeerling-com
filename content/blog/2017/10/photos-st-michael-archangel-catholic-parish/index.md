I was recently invited to take some pictures of the campus and interior of St. Michael the Archangel Catholic Church in Shrewsbury, MO (nestled in a neighborhood _just_ outside of the City of St. Louis), and I just finished processing and uploading them to Flickr; see my [St. Michael the Archangel photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/albums/72157690032896166).

There are so many of these little Catholic churches in St. Louis and around the country, with so much hidden beauty. I always try to find a neat little parish near where I stay in any city I visit; usually these parishes showcase more artwork than even the diocesan cathedrals—though that's [not the case in St. Louis](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeisaprayer/albums/72157684416499165)!
