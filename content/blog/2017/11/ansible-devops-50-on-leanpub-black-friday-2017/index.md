Though I've had a little less time to work on the book lately, I'm still very much invested in keeping Ansible for DevOps the best and most up-to-date guide to using Ansible for infrastructure automation. It's been over two years since the first '100% complete' edition was released, and in that time I have published over 200 updates on LeanPub—and even have full test coverage for all the book's examples, which are open-sourced and available in the [Ansible for DevOps GitHub repo](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops)!

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops">{{< figure src="./ansible-for-devops-50-off-bf2017.jpg" alt="Ansible for DevOps - 50% off for Black Friday 2017" width="325" height="423" class="insert-image" >}}</a></p>

For this year's Black Friday, [I'm discounting the book—50% off—but only on LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops). I like to push readers to LeanPub, because:

  - I can most easily publish frequent updates to the book via LeanPub (Kindle and iBooks only get updates 4x per year).
  - There is no DRM on LeanPub, ever—and you can choose what format you want!
  - LeanPub is the most generous and awesome publishing platform for authors I've used.

So special thanks to LeanPub for making Ansible for DevOps the [#12 all-time most popular book](https://leanpub.com/bookstore/type/book/sort/lifetime_earnings) sold on LeanPub, and the most consistently-up-to-date book on Ansible!

Go ahead and [get a copy of Ansible for DevOps from LeanPub for 50% off](https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops) before the deal expires!
