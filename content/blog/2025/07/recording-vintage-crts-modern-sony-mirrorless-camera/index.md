Growing up, I remember recording CRTs with _any_ camera was an exercise in frustration. You would either get a black bar that goes across everything, a slowly moving 'shutter' of darkness over the screen, black frame flickering, or even a variety of bright artifacts, especially when moving the camera around.

Just setting your camera's shutter speed to match the refresh rate _somewhat_ closely is usually enough to make it at least bearable (I start at 1/60th and see what looks least annoying).

But I recently discovered, while recording an old Macintosh Classic's CRT, that my Sony A7CII has a built-in anti-flicker feature that's... actually amazing.

It's located inside `Menu` > `Shooting` > `5 Shutter/Silent` > `Anti-flicker Set.`

Turn on `Var. Shutter`, then under the settings it allows you to dial in an exact refresh rate to target. There's an `Anti-flicker Tv Scan` option if you press the center button on the dial, but I've found that to not be super reliable.

Instead, I just watch the CRT through the camera as I increase or decrease the step. For my Mac Classic, I found a setting of `60.1` works best.

But every monitor is likely a little different.

With that setting, I was able to record for many minutes and besides maybe a faint line running down the screen (which could appear more readily when moving the camera), there were no more artifacts!
