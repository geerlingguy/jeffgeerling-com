If the size of the current AI bubble can be estimated by how many

- AI job offers
- AI product review offers
- AI service paid sponsorship offers

I receive per day... then I'd say we're nearing the pop.

There is no way the trillions of dollars of valuation placed on AI companies can be backed by any amount of future profit.

There are good use cases for machine learning, AI, etc. But sadly, the best ones are masked by the hype-train AI junk that is either useless or _incredibly_ expensive in comparison to the amount of money being charged for it. And hardware capabilities seem to be decelerating just as things like model training need more, for every small percentage gain.

The annoying thing is, I still have no idea if this bubble will pop this year, or in five years. I thought we were at a fever pitch in 2023... and in 2024...
