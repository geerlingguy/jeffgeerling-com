Today I set up a new DeskPi RackMate 12U model, the T2, and compared it to the other existing models (T0 / 4U and T1 / 8U)... and I have to ask: at what point are these racks not 'mini' anymore?

I posted a [short video about the 12U](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vgzjRN_SePI) in case you're interested in it—though many mini homelab enthusiasts have taken to [3D printing the entire rack](https://www.printables.com/model/1170708-modular-1010-inch-rack), or just buying two cheap rack rails and using equipment to screw them together! (It's certainly easier to stomach $10 in parts for a DIY mini rack instead of paying $150+ for a premium mini rack like DeskPi's!)

Since launching [Project MINI RACK](https://mini-rack.jeffgeerling.com) a few weeks ago, I've seen [_38 new builds_](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mini-rack/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22build+showcase%22) submitted to the Build Showcase, and the [r/minilab](https://reddstats.com/subreddit/minilab) subreddit has seen a nice surge in growth—and new ideas!

Pictured above is [helmarw's SDR-Station](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mini-rack/issues/140), which includes a rackmounted NanoVNA, a fold-up display, a 2.5/10 Gbps PoE switch, 2 Raspberry Pis, a Red Pitaya, two RTL-SDRs, a HackRF, and more!

One thing I think many people don't consider is how a mini rack can fit in many contexts besides just 'homelab'. There are other interesting radio and RF-related builds, and my Dad and I are working on rack setups for personal broadcast engineering and timing labs!
