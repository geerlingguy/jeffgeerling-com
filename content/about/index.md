## Father, author, developer, maker.

I build and scale large enterprise deployments on private and public cloud infrastructure. I'm deeply involved in open source communities, especially Linux, Ansible, Raspberry Pi, and Drupal.

I have a mildly popular [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling) and I write a lot (check out [my books](/books) or [my blog](/)).

Please consider [sponsoring my work](/sponsor).

Want to get in touch? Send me an email at _jeff (at) jeffgeerling.com_.
