# JeffGeerling.com Drupal Codebase

[![CI](https://github.com/geerlingguy/jeffgeerling-com/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/geerlingguy/jeffgeerling-com/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

This is the Drupal codebase that powers [JeffGeerling.com](https://www.jeffgeerling.com).

The building of this project and the migration of JeffGeerling.com from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 has been live-streamed on geerlingguy's YouTube channel; you can watch all the episodes and see episode summaries and resources here: [Migrating JeffGeerling.com from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 - How-to video series](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/migrating-jeffgeerlingcom-drupal-7-drupal-8-how-video-series).

I decided to open-source my website's codebase to help other Drupal users see how I built and maintain this site.

## Deploying to Production

Currently the process for deploying runs from the Midwestern Mac infrastructure playbook:

    ansible-playbook main.yml --tags=deploy

### Docker in Production

This repository includes a `Dockerfile.prod` intended for building a production-ready image (with all code and assets included).

To build that image:

    docker build -f Dockerfile.prod -t geerlingguy/jeffgeerling-com:arm64 .

Then you can push the image to the official [`geerlingguy/jeffgeerling-com`](https://hub.docker.com/r/geerlingguy/jeffgeerling-com) repository on Docker Hub:

    docker push geerlingguy/jeffgeerling-com:arm64

> Note: The image is automatically built and pushed to Docker Hub via GitHub Actions every time a commit is pushed to the `master` branch.

## Local Environment

The first time you start using this project, you need to create your local settings file:

    cp web/sites/default/example.settings.local.php web/sites/default/settings.local.php

Make sure you have Docker installed, then run the following command (in the same directory as this README file):

    docker compose up -d

Install PHP dependencies running Composer inside the container:

    docker compose exec drupal composer install

Visit http://localhost/ to see the Drupal installation. Visit http://localhost:8025/ to see MailHog.

### Installing Drupal

You can install Drupal using the install wizard, but we like to use Drush for more automation:

    docker compose exec drupal bash -c 'vendor/bin/drush site:install minimal --db-url="mysql://drupal:$DRUPAL_DATABASE_PASSWORD@$DRUPAL_DATABASE_HOST/drupal" --site-name="Jeff Geerling" --existing-config -y'

### Syncing the Database from Production

At some point, I'll write up how to do it all with Drush, automated.

For now:

  1. Open Sequel Ace, download database from prod server.
  2. Open Sequel Ace, upload database to local environment.

### Updating Configuration

Any time configuration is changed or any modules or Drupal is upgraded, you should export the site's configuration using the command:

    docker compose exec drupal bash -c 'vendor/bin/drush config:export -y'

And then push any changes to the Git repository before deploying the latest code to the site.

### Upgrading Core (and Contrib)

  1. Set up the site like normal, make sure it's installed.
  2. Run `docker compose exec drupal bash -c 'composer update'` (to update everything).
  3. Run `docker compose exec drupal bash -c 'vendor/bin/drush updb -y'`
  4. Run `docker compose exec drupal bash -c 'vendor/bin/drush config:export -y'`
  5. Commit any changes and push to remote.
  6. Run the deploy playbook to update the live site.

### Linting PHP code against Drupal's Coding Standards

You can test the custom code in this project using `phpcs`:

    docker compose exec drupal bash -c './vendor/bin/phpcs \
      --standard="Drupal,DrupalPractice" -n \
      --extensions="php,module,inc,install,test,profile,theme" \
      web/themes/jeffgeerling \
      web/modules/custom'

### Email Debugging with MailHog

The Docker configuration for this project enables a [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) container, which has a web UI available at `http://127.0.0.1:8025`.

The `php.ini` file for the local environment is automatically configured to use `mhsendmail` to send PHP's email through the mailhog instance when you're using this project's `Dockerfile` to build the Drupal environment.

When Drupal sends an email, it should be visible in Mailhog's UI.
